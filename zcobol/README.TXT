zcobol is a COBOL compiler which generates portable mainframe assembler 
source code with user defined data and paragraph labels.  The generated 
code can then be assembled and executed using z390 on any J2SE platform 
including Windows or Linux or the source code can be ported to IBM 
z9/z10 mainframe systems and assembled using HLASM.
