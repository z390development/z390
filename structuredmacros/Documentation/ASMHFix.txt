    Fix for the use of the IBM Asselbler H with this set of Structured Programming Macros

This technique is to allow correct code to be produced by this macro set in the event that the program(s) will be processed by the IBM Assembler H. It is not recommended to use this fix if the processing will be provided by the IBM High Level Assembler (HLASM) or the z390 Portable Assembler.

Instead of using the following, or similar, statement to provide the source input for the assembler:

//SYSIN  DD    DISP=SHR,DSN=<HIGHLVL.USERID.SRCLIB(PGMNAME)>

you should use the following update. Assembler H does not support the JUMP instruction; the BRANCH instruction will now be substituted for all instances of the JUMP instruction:

//SYSIN  DD    *
