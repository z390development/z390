This is the README.TXT file for the Structured Programming Macros (SPM)

This set of SPMs is distributed free of charge under the GNU General Public License.

THIS SPM MACRO SET PUTS THE FUN BACK INTO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING !!!

These macros may be processed by IBM's High Level Assembler (HLASM) or by the z390 Portable Assembler, plus, with one small fix, by IBM's Assembler H Version 2. To use these macros with Assembler H, please refer to the ASMH.TXT file in this directory. Using any assembler program other than these tested assemblers may produce unpredictable results.

This distribution file is named SPM.ZIP. Two files and two directories are contained within this main directory. The files are this readme.txt file, the ASMHFix.txt file, and the EXPLAIN.DOCX file which serves as a quick introduction to the simplicity and the power of this macro set. Along with brief descriptions of the logic used in each example, it shows the instructions, generated by IBM's HLASM, which deploy the logic that was requested in the IF macro call.

Please continue reading this readme.txt file, but you need to refer to ASMHFix.txt only if you are planning to use IBM's Assembler H with this macro set; if either of the other tested assemblers are going to be used, then this Assembler H fix is not required.

There are two directories contained within this SPM.ZIP file. The zOS and the z390 directories each contain two directories: the LISTINGS and the SOURCE.
Within SOURCE are the files to create a useful maclib and source lib for each system. For zOS, SOURCE contains the source in IEBUPDTE input format, and for z390 it coutains the files with their appropriate file types to be processed by the z390 Portable Assembler. The LISTINGS directories contain the output of HLASM or the z390 Assembler for your inspection. In the zOS directory the DOTEST and IFTEST listings include, at the end, the output obtained by executing the program

The two programs named DODOC and IFDOC were created for display purposes only and are not intended to be executed. These two programs provide examples of a wide variety of the processing that these macros provide, and their purpose is for the assembly listing to be visually examined to provide better understanding of the possible uses of these macros.

In order to start using this macro set on an MVS or zOS system, please execute the IEBUPDTE program against the two files in the zOS directory, loading the code into your MACLIB or SRCLIB as appropriate. The program being executed should be accessed via the SRCLIB, while the MACLIB should be in your concatenation of macro libraries in a position such that its macro definitions are the ones accessed.

To use the macros using the z390 Portable Assembler, please copy the files from z390/SOURCE into your source directory location for z390.
