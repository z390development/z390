# Contributing to z390

The following document will provide details on how to contribute to the z390
project. For how to contribute to the documentation, see 
[contributing to documentation](contribute_docs.md)

## Setup and build

### Install Java SDK

Make sure you have a Java SDK available to compile the application.

The project has moved to the [Apache Adoptium Java SDK](https://adoptium.net) 
(previously AdoptOpenJDK) for distribution builds.

z390 requires Java 1.8 or greater.

You can check if this is available by running the following command:

    shell> javac -version
    javac 1.8.0_312`   # you should receive a message like this

### Install git

The z390 source code is maintained in a git repository.

To install git on your system, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
to download the appropriate version for your system.

You can find a quick reference for some frequently used git commands
the bottom of this document.

### Clone the code

Start with a clone of the main repository.

    shell> git clone https://github.com/z390development/z390.git
    shell> cd z390

Once you are ready to submit changes, you will need a fork of the z390 
repository. See <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>
for more details.

### Build the code

=== "Windows"

    `bat> BUILD.BAT`

=== "MacOS/Unix"
        
    `bash> ./build.sh`

If the job successfully runs, it means you are ready to start development.

This build procedure invokes the full regression testing script.
Build and regression testing both can take quite some time.
Luckily, you do not need to do this very often.

### Rebuild the JAR

You can just recompile the JAR without running the full build job by running
the bldjar script.

=== "Windows"

    `bat> bat\BLDJAR.BAT`

=== "MacOS/Unix"
        
    `bash> bash/bldjar`

## Test the jar

gradle info: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html

in z390, to access and use the gradle commands, you first have to
make the z390test subdirectory your current or working directory.

The test scripts are in subdirectory z390test\src\test\groovy\org\z390\test

### Quick reference with some gradle commands

Action                                    | Command
------------------------------------------|------------
get a list of gradlew command options     | `gradlew --help`
force a test run                          | `gradlew test --rerun`
run a specific test/testset               | `gradlew test --tests 'pattern'`
run all zCobol tests                      | `gradlew test --tests '*cbl*'`

## Proposing new functionality

Enhancements are welcome, but be aware that you are stepping into 
an existing and well established project. 

Before you spend time on an enhancement, we __strongly__ suggest
that you first discuss your proposal with the core team and get their 
buy-in before progressing.

The best place to have these discussions is on the 
[z390 developer Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/z390development).

Once you get approval from the group, you can work on your change via the 
standard GitHub pull request model.

## Submitting changes

Changes can be submitted to the project by creating a pull request on the 
[z390 project repository](https://github.com/z390development/z390).


## Useful technical details

The following section is to provide some technical background for new developers.

### Project structure

The following directories provide tests and demos for various features 
available in z390.

Directory     | Description

vsam2         | VSAM file support (version 2)
vse           | VSE OS support

### Compatibility macros

z390 includes a number of macros that are interface compatible with those 
provided by mainframe operating systems. 

The internal operation of the macros is different from a real mainframe.
For example, the SVC instructions used by z390 are not the same as SVC
calls used by z/OS.

This means, if you want to write programs that will work on a real mainframe
then you need to use the supplied macros to perform the OS based actions. 
You cannot write programs that use SVC commands as they are not the 
same.

### Structured macro extensions

z390 extends the standard HLASM syntax with additional keywords that allow you 
to write structured macro code.

See [Structured Macro Extensions](../user_guide/z390/structured_macro.md) for more details.

This makes writing macros easier but structured macros are NOT compatible 
with HLASM.

Structured macro extensions are used extensively in the codebase which means
moving between the mainframe and z390 has some challenges.

The project is looking at how to make this transition easier as it understands
z390 users come here because they want to write and run HLASM programs and 
macros.
