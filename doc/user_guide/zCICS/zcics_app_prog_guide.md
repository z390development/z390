# zCICS Application Programming Guide

## Introduction

The EXEC CICS commands and parameters listed here are the only ones currently
supported in the zCICS environment.

Differences between mainframe operation and zCICS are explained.

For the operation of each command and parameter please refer to the Manuals
listed in the Reference section at the end of this document.

If you create your own zCICS applications, it would be wise to create a .BAT file that
re-assembles them all in one go. The internal interfaces are volatile at present and
this will be a frequent instruction.

The current zCICS environment and all test programs can be re-assembled using
DFHALL.BAT. The test VSAM catalog and files can be rebuilt using DFHALLV.BAT.
Assembly notes

The `CICS` option must be used when executing `mz390` command.

PROLOG and EPILOG are defaults.

NOEPILOG is supported but not fully tested, testing and correct usage is scheduled
for a future release of zCICS.

PROLOG inserts the following:

DFHEISTG
:  Define the prefix areas of the Dynamic Storage Area (DSA).

DFHEIEND
:  Replaces the END statement and defines the end of the DSA.

DFHEIENT
:  Replaces the first CSECT statement
:  Establish linkage and base registers
:  GETMAIN the DSA
:  Establish addressability to the EIB and TCTTE
:  Some COMMAREA management

## Other macros

* DFHEIBLK - EIB DSECT
* DFHPCT - Transaction definition
* DFHFCT – File definitions and options
* EXEC - Converts EXEC CICS statements into a unique macro call with a parameter list
* DFHREGS – A synonym for EQUREGS

## Copy books

* DFHAID - Standard CICS equates for AID keys
* DFHBMSCA - Mapping support equates
* DFHPCTUS - User transaction codes
* DFHFCTUS - User file definitions

Inclusion of the macro DFHREGS/EQUREGS is mandatory.

## Register Usage

* R0 - Reserved for internal use
* R1 - Reserved for internal use
* R10 - TCTTE address, must not be modified
* R11 - EIB address, must not be modified
* R12 - Default base register
* R13 - DSA address, must not be modified
* R14 - Reserved for internal use
* R15 - Reserved for internal use

### Multiple base registers (assembler only)

The standard entry for a CICS program is as follows:
e.g. DFHEISTG DSECT

``` hlasm
MYFIELD  DS    CL100 demo user field
......
MYPROG   CSECT
```

This standard method with the PROLOG option (default) will generate a single code
base of R12 and a single DSA base of R13.

If you want to extend the code base and/or the DSA base registers, convert your
code in line with the sample given and include the `NOPROLOG` option in mz390 command.

e.g. DFHEISTG

```hlasm
MYFIELD  DS    CL100 demo user field
......
MYPROG   DFHEIENT CODEREG=(R8,R5),DATAREG=(R13,R6,R7)
```

!!! Note
    You cannot override the first DATAREG value, it will always be R13.
    i.e. if you code `DATAREG=(R6,R7)` you will get `DATAREG=(R13,R7)`.

There is no cross-checking for register conflicts.

## Assembler EXEC CICS command syntax

There is no formal definition of an EXEC CICS command in any IBM CICS(r) Manual.

These assembler syntaxes are currently supported.

### In-line space separated
```hlasm
name     EXEC  CICS function subfunction parm parm()
```

### In-line comma separated
```hlasm
name     EXEC  CICS function,subfunction,parm,parm(), parm ()
```

### Split, space separated

Non-blank in column 72 is assumed for all lines except the last.

Comments are only allowed following a dot or comma delimiter on the last line.
```hlasm
name     EXEC  CICS function                                          X
         subfunction                                                  X
         parm                                                         X
         parm() parm (). a nice comment
```

### Split, comma separated

Comments are allowed on all lines that end with comma+space.

```hlasm
name     EXEC  CICS function, some                                    X
         subfunction, very                                            X
         parm, nice                                                   X
         parm(),parm (), comments
```

_name_ is supported and optional.

`EXEC CICS` is expected, `EXECUTE CICS` is not currently supported.

`subfunction` is optional and depends on the function but must follow function, 
e.g. `EXEC CICS WRITEQ TS`

`parm()` without spacing and `parm ()` with spacing are allowed.

## VSAM support

See the [zCICS VSAM Guide]() for guidance in the setup of a VSAM environment.

This document also contains extensions to the VSAM facilities currently available.
## Basic Mapping Support
The `EXEC CICS` commands `RECEIVE MAP`, `SEND MAP` and `SEND CONTROL` are documented
here.

For general BMS documentation and the mapping macros DFHMSD, DFHMDI and
DFHMDF see the [zCICS BMS Guide]().

## zCOBOL support

EXEC CICS command format follows the rules for COBOL.

Each command must end END-EXEC (a following dot may affect the logic).

Parameters like `SET()` which address imported structures may use the ADDRESS
OF special register.

`LENGTH`, `FLENGTH` and `KEYLENGTH` which would normally allow a numeric option
may use the `LENGTH OF` special register.

### Extra Parameters

You can add `NOEDF` to any `EXEC CICS` command if you wish that command to be
excluded from a CEDF session.

You can add `NOEDF` to the mz390 command if you wish all CEDF intercepts in that
program excluded.

      length of INTO is used. This may raise the LENGERR condition if the
      data length is larger.
    * If LENGTH/FLENGTH is numeric then it specifies the maximum data
      length that can be received. LENGERR can be raised if the data length
      is larger.

```

#### Parameters

!!! Warning
    * TERMINAL and ASIS are accepted and discarded.
    * SET, FROM and LENGTH are not supported.

##### MAP

* MAP can be a quoted string, maximum 7 characters or a label pointing to a
  7-byte field.
* If MAP is a label, then INTO is mandatory.
    * The map structure will not be cleared before the mapping takes
      place.
* If MAP is a string, then INTO is optional.
    * If INTO is omitted, the default is map.I
    * The map structure will be cleared before the mapping takes place.

##### MAPSET

#### Conditions (RESP/RESP2)

!!! Note 
    EIBRESP2 is an extension for MAPFAIL; 
    please see the [zCICS BMS Guide]() for more information.

    Many of the conditions can arise through a mismatch of map and
    structure. Typically a map is re-assembled but the programs using it
    are not.

* INVMPSZ/0
* MAPFAIL/1 The map cannot be found in the mapset.
* MAPFAIL/2 A short read key (CLEAR or PA) has been pressed or there
  are no modified fields.
* MAPFAIL/3 Data has been received, but there are no named fields in the map.
* MAPFAIL/4 An SBA has been located, but there is no field in the map that matches.
* MAPFAIL/5 An SBA has been located, but it matches an unnamed field.
* MAPFAIL/6 The data received for this field is longer than the DFHMDF
  LENGTH= parameter.
* MAPFAIL/7 There has been a mismatch between the physical map and
  the DSECT.
* MAPFAIL/8 
    * Data to be processed by PICIN is over 31 digits.
    * Data is not numeric after being PACKed.
    * Data length is greater than the edit pattern allows.
* INVREQ/0

##### MAPSET

* MAPSET can be a quoted string, maximum 7 characters or a label pointing
  to an 8-byte field containing no more than 7 characters.
