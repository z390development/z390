# Commands

The following is a list of commands available as part of the z390 toolkit.

These commands are scripts that are included in the z390 source and distribution
and can be enabled by including the script directory in your system path.

Alternatively you can reference the scripts directly from the command line by
specifying the full path.

=== "Windows"

    `(z390 install dir)\bat`

=== "MacOS/Unix"
        
    `(z390 install dir)/bash`


## Command reference

### z390

Start the GUI interface with optional startup command file input.

### mac

Run mz390 macro processor to expand MLC macro source file to BAL assembler source file. 

### asm

Run mz390 and az390 assembler to expand MLC macro assembler source file and 
generate relocatable OBJ relocatable object file.  

!!! Note 
    The default object file format is binary 80 byte record mainframe compatible 
    format.  
    Use option OBJHEX for ASCII text format containing hex format for object 
    code.  The OBJHEX format supports single CSECT’s over 16 MB and you can read 
    the OBJ file for debugging purposes. 
    See [Z390 options](z390_options.md) for more details.
    
### asml 

Run mz390, az390, and lz390 to expand MLC macro assembler source, assemble, and 
link to generate 390 load module.

###	asmlg

Run mz390, az390, lz390 and ez390 to expand MLC macro source, assemble, link, 
and execute 390 load module.

### link

Run lz390 linker to read one or more relocatable OBJ files and create binary 
relocatable 390 load module file.  

If the linker option AUTOLINK is on, the linker will search SYSLIB OBJ file 
directory for external references to be statically linked. 

See [z390 options](z390_options.md) for more details. 

The linker includes options for AMODE and RMODE to control loading and execution 
modes.  

The linker also has optional input command file with suffix LKD which may 
contain explicit INCLUDE, ENTRY, ALIAS, and NAME commands.  

### exec

Run ez390 emulator to execute 390 load module. 

#### Interactive debugger

The ez390 emulator supports the following interactive test commands when the 
[TEST option](z390_options.md) is specified:

* `addr=sdt` – set memory value  (i.e. 1r?=x'80' changes mem at (r1) 31 bit
* `reg=sdt` - set register value (i.e. 15r=8 changes reg 15 to 8)
* `A addr` – set or reset up to 100 instruction address stops with hex address or relative expression such as *+4
* `B=addr` - set base for rel addr (ie B=15r% sets base to (r15) 24 bit
* `D` – display DCB file information from TIOT
* `E` – toggle between EBCDIC and ASCII mode
* `F` – display floating point registers F0-FF
* `G` - nn/addr/opcode - exec nn instr. or until specified instruction address or opcode is found with no trace.  One instruction is always executed before next opcode break even if it’s the same instruction such as a BCT 1,*.  Addresses are distinguished from count by hex . or relative expression term such as *, +, or -.
* `H`  -  list help command summary
* `J addr` -  jump to new addr and trace instruction
* `L`  - list all regs and trace current instruction
* `L reg` - list contents of register (ie l 1r dumps register 1
* `L addr len` - list contents of memory area (ie l 10. 4 dumps cvt addr
* `M` – display total memory in MB and total allocate and free bytes 
    * `P` – display current loaded program information from CDE including name, entry and length
    * `Q` - quit execution now
    * `R` – display general purpose registers R0-RF
* `S`  - clear register, address, and memory breaks
* `S reg??sdt`  - set break on register change
* `S addr??sdt` - set break on memory change
* `T nn/addr/opcode` - trace n instr. or until specified instruction address or opcode is found.  One instruction is always executed before next opcode break even if it’s the same instruction such as a BCT 1,*.  Addresses are distinguished from count by hex . or relative expression term such as *, +, or -.  The symbol EPA may be used in place of address to refer to last program load point address.
* `V` - validate/verify
    * `V * nn` - validate nn bytes starting at PSW address
    * `V psw.subfield` - validate PSW subfield
    * `V nnr` - validate GPR nn
* `Z`  - exit test and run to end of program without trace
* `* addr` = hex.,+-hex, *+-hex, dec, nnr% (24 bit), nnr? (31 bit)
* `* reg` = nnr where nn = 0-15
* `* sdt` = self defining term (b'01',c'ab',f'1',h'2',x'ff')
* `* ??` = break compare operator (=,!=,<,<=,>,>=)
