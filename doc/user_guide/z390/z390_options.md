# z390 Options

The scope value details where the option is used.

- M - mz390 macro processor which reads ASCII assembler source and generates expanded BAL
- A - az390 assembler which reads BAL and generated OBJ relocatable object code
- L - lz390 linker which reads OBJ relocatable object files and generates 390 load module
- E - ez390 emulator runtime which loads and executes 390 load module

!!! Note: most options can be prefixed with NO to turn the feature off.

!!! Note "Use of parameters with parentheses in *nix shells"
    Unix shells like sh and bash interpret parentheses if not quoted. For this reason, if you need to specify a parameter that contains
    parentheses, then that parameter should be quoted. 
    
    For example, the SYSMAC parameter is quoted as it uses parentheses, whereas the ALIGN parameter is not.

    `"SYSMAC(foldername)" ALIGN`

| @filename         | MALE  | Options in Z390.OPT file if found | Retrieve additional options from free form text file with default suffix OPT. Options can be specified delimited by spaces on as many lines as required. All characters on a line following \* are ignored as comments. The @file option can be nested. The default path is the program path. If a file named Z390.OPT exists in the z390 install directory, these options will be applied first as default options.                                                                                                                                      |

A hex dump of the tables and a list of the valid ASCII and EBCDIC Unicode Charset codepages are listed. You can replace the EBCDIC codepage name with a file specification such as IBM1047.HCP (example included) which is in hex dump format. The above defaults match z/OS.                                                                                                                |

When the TRACE??? option is specified, the CON option is turned off so only start/stop and abort error messages appear on console log.

NOTIME and NOTIMING both turn off this option. Use NOTIME to allow tasks such as SOA servers like z390CICS to run continuously while still supporting application use of timing functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

TIMING also displays current z390 and J2SE version on start message and memory usage on ended message. Note NOTIMING is used in regression tests to force generated files to be identical by using fixed data/time stamp using GregorianCalendar(2005,0,2,22,33,44). NOTIMING suppresses versions on start message and memory usage on ended message. NOTIMING also sets NOTIME which prevents application from using time functions. |

<a name="allow" id="allow">Note</a> on ALLOW mode: The following features are enabled in allow mode:
1. No quotes required for SETC variables
2. Duplication factor does not require (..)
3. Array declarations with variables in expression accepted
4. Substring starting beyond end returns null string
5. Quoted strings allowed in SETA and SETB expressions
6. Allow &var as null string if not found during substitution
7. Allow duplicate local and global variable declarations
8. Allow AREAD and PUNCH file records greater than 80 characters.

<a name="ascii" id="ascii">Note</a> on ASCII mode: ASCII mode is not mainframe compatible and requires careful review of program to insure no EBCDIC immediate compare constants
such as X'40', 64, X'F0', 240 etc. are used and that there are no assumptions about EBCDIC versus ASCII collating sequences which have numbers and letters reversed,
and EBCDIC letters are non-contiguous. Typically HLASM compatible programs are run in default EBCDIC mode and DCB RECFM=FT\|VT or some other translation option is used
to convert between EBCDIC and ASCII where necessary. Note there are a few instructions affected by ASCII mode:
1. ED/EDMK generate ASCII versus EBCDIC but the mask must always be in EBCDIC (masks are usually coded in X'...' format)
2. UNPK generates X'3' versus X'F' in zone field (high order nibble).

<a name="chkmac" id="chkmac">Note</a> on CHKMAC options:
- 0 - no checking
- 1 - check for missing AGO and AIF labels and issue warning
- 2 - also check missing labels and also check for non comment text after MEND

<a name="chksrc" id="chksrc">Note</a> on CHKSRC options:
- 0 - no checking
- 1 - check MLC or BAL input source files for any non-ASCII characters and issue error
- 2 - check MLC, MAC, CPY, and BAL input source files for any non-ASCII characters and issue error
- 3 - also check for out of sequence characters in 73-80 or any non-blank characters beyond 80 and issue error
- - Note this should detect any EBCDIC literal character strings containing non-ASCII characters such as binary 0 byte which must be changed to hex X'00' type strings for portability.

<a name="mnote" id="mnote">Note</a>  on MNOTE options:
- 0 - default generates MNOTE error/warning during mz390 and az390
- 1 - suppress mz390 error/warning and only pass MNOTE to az390

# <a name="trace" id="trace">Tracing</a> options and equivalences

TRACE will display every instruction executed along with address and value of each operand.
Any combination of the following trace options can be set using the TRACE(...) option.
TRACE(\*) will also set TRACEALL. Note the &SYSTRACE global SETC variable can be used to turn any trace options on or off during execution.
