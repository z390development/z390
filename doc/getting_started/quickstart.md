## Hello z390

The following is a simple *Hello world* application written in mainframe 
assembler language.

``` hlasm
HELLO    CSECT
         BASR  15,0
         USING *,15
         WTO   'Hello z390!'
         BR    14
         END
```

Add the contents of this to a file named 'HELLO.MLC'.

Now run the following z390 command to assemble, link and run the program.

=== "Windows"
    :material-information-outline: Assumes z390 has been installed in `c:\z390`. 
    Substitute for your local install location.

    ``` dos
    c:\z390\bat\asmlg HELLO.MLC SYSMAC(c:\z390\mac+)
    ```

=== "MacOS/Unix"
    :material-information-outline: Assumes z390 has been installed in `/usr/local/z390`. 
    Substitute for your local install location.
    ```
    /usr/local/z390/bash/asmlg HELLO.MLC "SYSMAC(/usr/local/z390/mac+)"
    ```

If you have successfully run the sample program, the output to the console will 
be similar to the following:

``` text
09:37:54 HELLO     MZ390 START USING z390 V1.7.03 ON J2SE 14.0.2 06/05/21
09:37:54 HELLO     MZ390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 0 MEM(MB)= 47 IO=200
09:37:55 HELLO     LZ390 START USING z390 V1.7.03 ON J2SE 14.0.2 06/05/21
09:37:55 HELLO     LZ390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 0 MEM(MB)=  8 IO=30
09:37:55 HELLO     EZ390 START USING z390 V1.7.03 ON J2SE 14.0.2 06/05/21
{==Hello z390!==}
09:37:55 HELLO     EZ390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 0 MEM(MB)= 16 IO=21 INS=5
```

## Hello zCOBOL

The following is a simple *Hello world* application written in COBOL.

``` cobol
        IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
        PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.

        PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            DISPLAY "HELLO ZCOBOL".
            STOP RUN.
```

Add the contents of this to a file named 'HELLO.CBL'.

Now run the following z390 command to assemble, link and run the COBOL program.

=== "Windows"
    :material-information-outline: Assumes z390 has been installed in `c:\z390`. 
    Substitute for your local install location.

    ``` dos
    c:\z390\bat\cblclg HELLO
    ```

=== "MacOS/Unix"
    :material-information-outline: Assumes z390 has been installed in `/usr/local/z390`. 
    Substitute for your local install location.
    ```
    /usr/local/z390/bash/cblclg HELLO
    ```

If you have successfully run the sample COBOL program, the output to the console 
will be similar to the following:

``` text
21:13:17 hello     ZC390 START USING z390 V1.7.07 ON J2SE 16.0.1 06/27/21
21:13:17 hello     ZC390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 0 MEM(MB)= 10 IO=2
21:13:18 hello     MZ390 START USING z390 V1.7.07 ON J2SE 16.0.1 06/27/21
21:13:19 hello     MZ390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 1 MEM(MB)=109 IO=19951
21:13:19 hello     LZ390 START USING z390 V1.7.07 ON J2SE 16.0.1 06/27/21
21:13:19 hello     LZ390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 0 MEM(MB)= 11 IO=72
21:13:19 hello     EZ390 START USING z390 V1.7.07 ON J2SE 16.0.1 06/27/21
{==HELLO ZCOBOL==}
21:13:19 hello     EZ390 ENDED   RC= 0 SEC= 0 MEM(MB)= 17 IO=185 INS=41
```
