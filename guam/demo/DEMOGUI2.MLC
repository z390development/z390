* RUN DEMOGUI2 WITH GUI OPTION TO DEMO WTO/WTOR GUI MCS CONSOLE
* WITH LOOP COUNTER RUNNING BETWEEN REPLYS TO SHOW MULTI-PROCESSING
*
* DEMOGUI2 CAN BE RUN IN 4 DIFFERENT MODES:
*    1. Windows command line interface                         
*       a.  Enter command: ez390 demo\demogui2
*       b.  Enter replies when prompted and terminal with END.
*       c.  When a WTOR reply is pending with GUI option off,
*           ez390 monitors the system standard input for keyboard input
*           and when ready, stores reply and posts ecb complete.
*
*    2. Windows z390 GUI system window interface               
*       a.  Enter command: ez390 demo\demogui2
*       b.  Enter replies when prompted and terminal with END.
*       c.  When a WTOR reply is pending GUI option off,
*           ez390 monitors the system standard input for keyboard input
*           and when ready, stores reply and posts ecb complete.  Note 
*           this case the standard input is supplied to ez390 process
*           started from the z390 GUI system window and the wto message
*           and reply messages are routed back to the z390 GUI system 
*           window scrolling log display.
*
*    3. Windows command line interface                         
*       a.  Enter command: ez390 demo\demogui2 gui
*       b.  Enter replies when prompted and terminal with END.
*       c.  When a WTOR reply is pending with GUI option on,
*           ez390 monitors the GUI application window for command input
*           and when ready, stores reply and posts ecb complete.  WTO
*           and reply messages are routed to the GUI application window
*           for display on MCS console view panel and are also logged 
*           on the z390 system log file.
*
*    4. Windows z390 GUI system window interface               
*       a.  Enter command: ez390 demo\demogui2 gui
*       b.  Enter replies when prompted and terminal with END.
*       c.  When a WTOR reply is pending with GUI option on,
*           ez390 monitors the GUI application window for command input
*           and when ready, stores reply and posts ecb complete.  WTO
*           and reply messages are routed to the GUI application window
*           for display on MCS console view panel.  Note in this case
*           wto messages and reply messages are also routed to the 
*           separate Z390 GUI system window scrolling log display and
*           system log file.
*
*   See DEMOGUI1 for simllar demo using WAIT for each reply.
