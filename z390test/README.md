# z390test

This folder contains a framework for testing the z390 application.

This is a black box test framework and does not perform unit testing
of the actual z390 code. It calls the z390 app via a shell command.

The idea is that you can run z390 with input and then check the output 
from the process.


## Setup

Build the z390 Java jar and libraries for use by the tests. From the z390 root:

    ./build.sh
    win> BUILD.BAT

## Run 

By default the tests will not show the output of the `printOutput` method (see below).
While developing tests, it is useful to see this output.

    export Z390_PRINT_OUTPUT 1
    win> SET Z390_PRINT_OUTPUT=1

Run the tests from z390test clone directory

    cd z390test
    ./gradlew test
    win> gradlew test

If you use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, they have support for Gradle test suites.

## Writing test cases

Module `TESTINS1.MLC` resides in the z390 tests subdirectory. The following is a basic test 
case that executes an assembly of the module and checks the return code.

```groovy
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class TestZ390Test extends z390Test {

    var options = ['trace', 'noloadhigh', "SYSMAC(${basePath("mac")})"]

    @Test
    void test_file_source() {
        int rc = this.asm(basePath('tests', 'TESTINS1'), *options)
        this.printOutput()
        assert rc == 0
    }
}
```

To use the standard framework, your class should extend `z390Test`
which provides methods for running and capturing the output.

The tests use standard JUnit test structures.

## Methods for testing

The z390Test class embeds a number of methods for interacting with z390 similar
to the scripts you would use.

### assemble from file

```groovy
int rc = this.asm(basePath('tests', 'TESTINS1'), *options)
assert rc == 0
```
Parameters:
* asmFile - The HLASM file without prefix to assemble. Use basePath method to build path relative to z390.
* args... - 0-n parmeters to pass to the asm program, generally options.

Returns:
* rc - The result code from the execution

Methods available :
* asm - Assemble only
* asml - Assemble and link. Any non zero RC on assemble will exit with RC
* asmlg - Assemble, link and go. Any non zero RC on assemble and link will exit with RC
* mz390 - Assemble only
* cblc - COBOL compile only
* cblclg - COBOL compile, link and go. Any non-zero return will exist with RC
* lz390 - Link only. Output not cleared prior to run
* ez390 - Run only. Output not cleared prior to run

### assemble from inline source

```groovy
var source = """TESTBR14 CSECT
         SR    15,15
         BR    14
         END
"""
String sourceFilename = createTempFile("INLINE.MLC", source)
int rc = this.asm(sourceFilename, *options)
assert rc == 0
```
Use the `createTempFile` method to create a file that can be
used in the assembly.

### Set environment variables

```groovy
this.env = ['SNAPOUT': basePath('zopcheck', 'SNAPOUT.TXT')]
```
The env property is a set of key value pairs within a Java or [Groovy map](https://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/util/Map.html). 
These will be passed as environment variables for the z390 calls.

To add a single envvar without replacing any previously set environment variables:
```groovy
this.env.put('SNAPOUT', basePath('zopcheck', 'SNAPOUT.TXT'))
```


### loadFile -- loads content of a file into fileData

```groovy
loadFile(filename, label)
```
* filename - is the file that will be loaded into the fileData area.
* label - the key in the fileData hashlist

You can access the file contents after loading the file

```groovy
fileData[label] 
```

### printOutput -- prints captured data

```groovy
printOutput()
```
Prints the captured output to stdout - useful for debugging output.

Captured output includes stdout, stderr, the assembly output files (LST, LOG, PRN and ERR files) 
and any other files you load using the `loadFile` method.

First 5 digits are line numbers starting at 0 are included in the listing.

### basePath -- construct path relative to z390 source root

```groovy
basePath("tests", "TESTINS1")
```

Use this to construct file paths relative to the z390 source root. Ensures platform independent 
file handling.

Set the z390 source root using envvar `Z390_SOURCE_ROOT`. If not provided, defaults to "../z390"

### createTempFile -- create a temp file for use in the test

```groovy
var tempFileContents = """Line 1: Some text
Line 2: This is a test file
"""
var tempFilename = createTempFile("myTempFile.txt", tempFileContents)
println(tempFilename)
```

Use this to create temp files used in your tests. Returns full path to temp filename.

If you need to include the name of the generated file in the file, use `{{fullFileName}}` placeholder in
file contents and the function will replace this with the actual filename created.

Note - The temporary file and generated temporary directory will be deleted at end of testcase.


## Hints and tips

### Need to execute logic before tests run 

You have 2 options.

#### Run logic before all tests in class only once


```groovy
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInstance
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInstance.Lifecycle

@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
class MyTestClass extends z390Test {

    @BeforeAll
    void run_once_for_class() {
        // put your logic here
    }
}
```

#### Run logic before each test in a class

```groovy
class MyTestClass extends z390Test {

    @BeforeEach
    void run_before_every_test() {
        // put your logic here
    }
}
```

### Send printOutput to stdout

By default, the printOutput command will not send its output.
The following section shows you how to see the output.

#### for a specific test

```groovy
@Test
void my_test() {
    printOutput = true
    // test code here
}

```

#### for a specific class

```groovy
class MyTestClass extends z390Test {
    MyTestClass() {
        printOutput = true
    }
}
```

#### for all tests

```bash
export Z390_PRINT_OUTPUT=1
```
