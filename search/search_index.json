For how to contribute to the documentation, see contributing to documentation Setup and build Install Java SDK Make sure you have a Java SDK available to compile the application. The project has moved to the Apache Adoptium Java SDK (previously AdoptOpenJDK) for distribution builds. z390 requires Java 1.8 or greater.

The best place to have these discussions is on the z390 developer Google group . Once you get approval from the group, you can work on your change via the standard GitHub pull request model. Submitting changes Changes can be submitted to the project by creating a pull request on the z390 project repository .

The internal operation of the macros is different from a real mainframe. For example, the SVC instructions used by z390 are not the same as SVC calls used by z/OS. This means, if you want to write programs that will work on a real mainframe then you need to use the supplied macros to perform the OS based actions. You cannot write programs that use SVC commands as they are not the same. Structured macro extensions z390 extends the standard HLASM syntax with additional keywords that allow you to write structured macro code. See Structured Macro Extensions for more details. This makes writing macros easier but structured macros are NOT compatible with HLASM. Structured macro extensions are used extensively in the codebase which means moving between the mainframe and z390 has some challenges. The project is looking at how to make this transition easier as it understands z390 users come here because they want to write and run HLASM programs and macros.

If you are an assembler or COBOL developer who would like to contribute to the zCOBOL open source project, join the zCOBOL group and indicate your specific interests. All users are welcome and are encouraged to submit bug reports and requests for priority on future open source zCOBOL and z390 development.

See ASSIST User Manual PART II. INPUT/OUTPUT AND DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS for more details. Using ASSIST instructions with z390 ASSIST option The ASSIST option must be provided to use the ASSIST instructions. See z390 Options for details. assist command script z390 assist command script can be used to assemble, link, and execute ASSIST programs. assist {programname} The assist command script enables ASSIST option and defines the following files for input and output: XREAD={programname}.XRD XPRNT={programname}.XPR XPNCH={programname}.XPH XGET={programname}.XGT XPUT={programname}.XPT File processing Files are optional and will be opened on first access and closed at end of execution or end of file. All files are ASCII with automatic conversion from or to EBCDIC. ASCII file records have trailing spaces removed and end with carriage return x'0d' and line feed x'0a'. Input fields are padded with EBCDIC spaces x'40'. Non ASCII output bytes are converted to periods. Default ASSIST option behavior Using the ASSIST option enables z390 options NOLOADHIGH and NOINIT for compatibility with the original ASSIST assembler and simplifies relative address calculations. This has the following impacts: Programs are loaded at X'8000' instead of high end of memory. Registers are initialized to X'F4'. Memory above the PSA is initialized to X'F5'. Uninitialized areas of 390 load modules are initialized to X'F6'. You can use the options LOADHIGH and INIT to override this behavior. See z390 Options for more information. Error handling A trace table is used to display the last 10 instructions prior to abnormal termination of a program when the TRACE option is off. The PSW displayed at abnormal termination includes ILC, CC, MASK, and AMODE. ASSIST instructions XDECI - Convert decimal to binary Format: RX X'53rxbddd' r1.s2 Start scan for next decimal number at s2 skipping leading blanks. Convert decimal number to binary in r1 until non decimal character found or more than nine digits. When ten (or more) digits are found, the instruction does not do the conversion and condition code 3 is set. Set register 1 to address of the last non decimal character found. Set condition code 0 if number converted successfully else set condition code 3. XDECO - Convert binary to decimal Format: RX X'52rxbddd' r1,s2 Convert binary 32 bit r1 value to right justified 12 character decimal field at s2. XDUMP - dump registers and/or storage Format: RXSS X'E06xbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 If no operands are specified, dump registers and the default storage area. If no XLIMD instruction has reset default storage dump area, dump all storage. if s1(x1) address of storage area and s2 length of area are specified just dump that area. XGET - read record from ASCII file Format: RXSS X'E0Axbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 Read record from ASCII file DDNAME=XGET into area s1(x1) with length of s2. Requires that the environment variable XGET be set and point to desired input file. If a file operation is successful the condition code is set to 0. At end of file, condition code 1 is set. If a file open error occurs, program terminates with S013 abend with error message showing the file specification which failed. If any other error occurs such as missing length, condition code 2 is set. XHEXI - convert hex to binary Format: RX X'61' r1,s2 Convert hex to binary (cc3 if no hex, update field addr). XHEXO - convert binary to hex Format: RX X'62' r1,s2 Convert value in r1 to printable hex (8 bytes), storing value at s2. XLIMD - Set default dump storage area Format: RXSS X'E08xrbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 Set default XDUMP storage area address and length. XPNCH - Write to punch Format: RXSS X'E04xbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 Write to DDNAME=XPNCH with length s2. Requires that the environment variable XPNCH be set and point to desired output file. Does not set condition code. If a file error occurs the program aborts with abend code S013. If a file open error occurs, program terminates with S013 abend with error message showing the file specification which failed. XPRNT - Write to print Format: RXSS X'E02xbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 Write to DDNAME=XPRNT with length s2. Requires that the environment variable XPRNT be set and point to desired output file. Does not set condition code. If a file error occurs, the program aborts with abend code S013. If a file open error occurs, program terminates with S013 abend with error message showing the file specification which failed. XPUT - Write to XPUT Format: RXSS X'E0Cxbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 Write to DDNAME=XPUT for length s2. Requires that the environment variable XPUT be set and point to desired output file. If a file operation is successful the condition code is set to 0. If a file open error occurs, program terminates with S013 abend with error message showing the file specification which failed. If any other error occurs such as missing length, condition code 2 is set. XREAD - Read from XREAD Format: RXSS X'E00xbdddbddd' s1(x1),s2 Read record from DDNAME=XREAD for length s2. Requires that the environment variable XREAD be set and point to desired input file. If a file operation is successful the condition code is set to 0. At end of file, condition code 1 is set.

Output: Records are written LRECL at a time. RECFM=FB Fixed Blocked Translation: None Input: MACRF=GM Records are read LRECL at a time out of BLKSIZE. MACRF=R or RW The whole block is read. Output: MACRF=PM Records are written LRECL at a time into a block of size BLKSIZE. CLOSE may write a short block. MACRF=W or RW The whole block is written. RECFM=V Variable Translation: None Input: Each record is prefixed by the RDW. The receiving area must be big enough for the largest RDW+record. If the RDW indicates a record size larger than LRECL, abend S013 will occur. Output: Each record must be prefixed by the RDW. RECFM=VB Variable Blocked Translation: None Input: MACRF=GM Each record is prefixed by the RDW. The receiving area must be big enough for the largest RDW+record. If the RDW indicates a record size larger than LRECL, abend S013 will occur. MACRF=R or RW The whole block is read, prefixed by the BDW. The receiving area must be big enough for the largest BDW+block. If the BDW indicates a block size larger than BLKSIZE, abend S013 will occur. Output: MACRF=PM Each record must be prefixed by the RDW. CLOSE will write the last block. Each block written will have the BDW automatically inserted at the start. MACRF=W or RW Each block must be prefixed by the BDW. RECFM=FT Fixed ASCII text Translation: ASCII mode: None Non-ASCII mode input ASCII chars are translated to EBCDIC after being read. Non-ASCII mode output EBCDIC chars are translated to ASCII before being written, this is an internal function and does not affect the record in storage. Non-EBCDIC chars may be translated to X'00'. Input: The file is assumed to be in conventional ASCII format, with each record ending in the operating system specific end-of-line (EOL) character(s). EOL is never read as part of the record. If the record is shorter than LRECL, then trailing blanks are inserted. EODAD is invoked when all bytes have been read. Output: EOL is inserted at the end of each record after trailing blanks are stripped. RECFM=VT Variable ASCII text Translation: ASCII mode None Non-ASCII mode input ASCII chars are translated to EBCDIC after being read. Non-ASCII mode output EBCDIC chars are translated to ASCII before being written. This is an internal function and does not affect the record in storage. Non-EBCDIC chars may be translated to X'00'. Input: The file is assumed to be in conventional ASCII format, with each record ending in the operating system specific end-of-line (EOL) character(s). EOL is never read as part of the record. Each record is prefixed with the RDW. EODAD is invoked when all bytes have been read. The receiving area must be big enough for the largest RDW+record. If the RDW indicates a record size larger than LRECL, abend S013 will occur. Output: Each record must be prefixed with the RDW. EOL is inserted at the end of each record after trailing blanks are stripped. Warning The RDW is not written. RECORD - Record address RECORD DSECT=DCBREC Type=A Default=0 (undefined) Default I/O area which can be overridden on the GET/PUT/READ/WRITE macros. Can this be set in the DCB prior to OPEN: Yes Can this be set in the DCB after OPEN : Yes If omitted, then the I/O area must be specified on the GET/PUT/READ/WRITE macros. LRECL - Record length LRECL DSECT=DCBLRECLF Type=F Default=0 Can this be set in the DCB prior to OPEN: Yes Can this be set in the DCB after OPEN : Yes Maximum value is 2G-1. For RECFM=F or FB, sets the record size. For all other RECFM, sets the maximum record size. For RECFM=F, LRECL=0 is valid, provided that BLKSIZE is set. For RECFM=FB, LRECL must be a multiple of BLKSIZE. For variable records, include 4 for the RDW. The field DCBLRECL (Type=H) is retained for compatibility. BLKSIZE - Block size BLKSIZE DSECT=DCBBLKSIF Type=F Default=0 Can this be set in the DCB prior to OPEN: Yes Can this be set in the DCB after OPEN : Yes Maximum value is 2G-1. LRECL and BLKSIZE cannot both be zero. For RECFM=F sets the record size if LRECL=0. For RECFM=FB, sets the block size and LRECL must be a multiple of BLKSIZE. For RECFM=VB, BLKSIZE must be at least 4 greater than LRECL. For all other RECFM, sets the maximum block size. The field DCBBLKSI (Type=H) is retained for compatibility. DCBE - Data control block extension DCBE DSECT=DCBDCBE Type=A Default=0 (undefined) The DCBE is a control block defined by the DCBE macro. Can this be set in the DCB prior to OPEN: Yes Can this be set in the DCB after OPEN : Yes When defined, the addresses of the end-of-file (EODAD) and the I/O error routine (SYNAD) may be defined. When set, these addresses override the DCB EODAD and SYNAD parameters. The DSECT IHADCBE maps the DCBE control block. EODAD - End of file routine EODAD DSECT=DCBEODAD Type=Address Default=0 (no routine defined) The address of the end-of-file routine. Can this be set in the DCB prior to OPEN: Yes Can this be set in the DCB after OPEN : Yes This may be overridden if DCBE is coded. If a further GET is done after end-of-file, then the program is terminated. SYNAD - Error analysis routine SYNAD DSECT=DCBSYNAD Type=Address Default=0 (no routine defined) The address of the uncorrectable I/O error routine. Can this be set in the DCB prior to OPEN: Yes Can this be set in the DCB after OPEN : Yes This may be overridden if DCBE is coded. DCBE - Data Control Block Extended label DCBE EODAD=0,SYNAD=0,BLKSIZE=0 EODAD - End of data routine address Address of End of data routine.

Info z390 has the following GUAM GUI interface support and limits: Full support for the MCS console view for WTO and WTOR commands Full support for the TN3270 edit mode form of TGET and TPUT Full support for basic TN3270 data streams including WCC, SBA, SF, IC, RA, EUA, and PT commands. A cursor is supported using blinking underline character at the current cursor position. The arrow, backspace, delete, and tab keys are supported to control the cursor. Entering data into protected field or alpha into numeric field causes beep and status line error message. The 3270 screen display can be resized and the font is automatically adjusted to maximum size that will still allow display of full screen if possible. Limited support for TN3270 extended data streams with SFE and SA commands are supported. Color attributes are supported but highlighting and underlining are not yet supported. Limited support for the GUAM macro graphics commands. (The GUI WINDOW, VIEW, GRAPH command can be used to display the graph view but the graphic commands are targeted for future release.

Whenever TPUT, or TGET macros are executed the GUI window switches to TN3290 screen view display mode. Whenever GUAM macro graphic commands are executed, the GUI window switches to GRAPH display mode. When in SCREEN or GRAPH view, WTO and WTOR commands can continue to be executed and displayed one at a time via the status line with command line replies as required. The user can switch between any of the 3 GUAM GUI views manually via view menu selection. Assembler application programs can set window title, location, size, font, and view mode at any time using the GUAM macros regardless of display view. Multiple user controlled GUAM GUI windows can be opened by executing different assembler programs as separate tasks under control of master program using the z390 CMDPROC macro to launch separate program tasks each of which can invoke a GUAM GUI interface. Demonstrations The following GUI demonstration programs are included in the distribution in the guam/demo folder. DEMOGUI1.MLC \u2013 Issue WTOR, wait for reply via WAIT, display reply via WTO and repeat loop until END is entered. This program can be run in any of the following modes: Windows command line mode \u2013 ASMLG DEMO\\DEMOGUI1 Windows GUI interface \u2013 ASMLG DEMO\\DEMOGUI1 GUI DEMOGUI2.MLC \u2013 Issue WTOR, execute 3 instruction loop until ECB is posted, display reply via WTO along with date, time, instruction loop count and calculated MIP rate for the 3 instruction loop. It is very interesting to note that on a 3 GHZ Pentium 4 system, this demo runs at about 1.1 MIPS using command line mode, and about 2.6 MIPS using the GUI mode. This program can be run in any of the following modes: Windows command line mode \u2013 ASMLG DEMO\\DEMOGUI1 Windows GUI interface \u2013 ASMLG DEMO\\DEMOGUI1 GUI DEMOGUI3.MLC \u2013 issue TPUT and TGET with WAIT option in loop until END is entered. This demo uses default EDIT mode of TPUT and TGET to scroll the 24 lines of TN3270 screen view with wrap around after status line prompt for input each time last line is written. DEMOGUI4.MLC \u2013 issue TN3270 data stream TPUT and TGET with WAIT option in loop until END is entered. This demo writes text to fields at specified screen buffer addresses, reads a field at specified address, displays the input field at another address, and repeats the process waiting for screen input until PF3 or END is entered. DEMOGUI5.MLC \u2013 This demo used GUI graphic commands to draw text and graphics and read keyboard and mouse. (Note this program brings up graphic display view but the graphics commands are not implemented yet.

The callee: Saves GR14 to GR12 (registers at entry to the called program) at +12 of the caller's save area Obtains its own save area (the called program's save area) Stores the address of its save area at +8 of the caller's save area (caller's forward chain) Stores the address of the caller's save area (GR13 at entry) at +4 of its (the called program's) save area (called program's back chain) Loads GR13 with the address of its (the called program's) save area At this point the called program begins its processing. If it calls another program steps 1--5 are repeated; this time the \"caller\" is the current program and there is a new called program. When the called program finishes processing, it returns to the caller as follows: The called program uses its back chain (+4 in its save area) to restore GR13 to caller's save area The called program restores GR14 to GR12 from that save area (restores registers at entry); there are cases when GR15, GR0, and/or GR1 are not restored -- depends on the program. The called program returns to the caller by doing an unconditional branch to the address in GR14. This calling convention is explained in detail in the IBM z/OS Version 2 Release 4 MVS Programming: Assembler Services Guide (SA23-1368-40) . Refer to Chapter 2 - Linkage conventions. GR15 by convention may contain a return code upon exit. Program parameters There are two methods of passing parameters to a program. At assembly time using SYSPARM At run time using PARM In either case enclose the entire parm to be passed in double quotes. The double quotes are required to handle commas and spaces that otherwise cause command processors to split the parm. The double quotes are not required if there are no commas or spaces in the text. Assembly time - SYSPARM If single quotes are included in text, they are passed on to &SYSPARM. There is a limit of 32767 bytes for the text. SYSPARM will be transferred to the macro variable &SYSPARM. mz390 ... \"SYSPARM(HELLO WORLD)\" Access the text by coding: label DC C'&SYSPARM' ...... will translate to label DC C'HELLO WORLD' Run time - PARM PARM can be accessed via GR1 at program entry. GR1 will contain an address that points to a fullword in storage which points to a storage location with the parm length in a halfword followed by the parm value. ez390 ... \"PARM(HELLO WORLD)\" The fullword pointed to by GR1 points to: DC H'11',C'HELLO WORLD'` If single quotes are included around text in PARM they are removed. ez390 ... \"PARM('HELLO WORLD')\" Will also result in the fullword pointed to by GR1 pointing to: DC H'11',C'HELLO WORLD'` Usage The program is run with the parameter passed ez390 myprog \"PARM('HELLO WORLD')\" The program code: L R2,0(,R1) R2=address of parm length(HW)+value LH R3,0(,R2) R3=length of parm value BCTR R3,0 Subtract 1 from R3 - length for use in machine code EX R3,MOVE Execute MOVE instruction using length code from R3 ...... MOVE MVC PARM(0),2(R2) Move instruction used by EX PARM DC CL80' ' Work area for parm value GR1 is populated by ez390 with the parm address pointer. GR2 is loaded with the address of the parm length and address - fullword pointed to by GR1. GR3 is loaded with the parm length - halfword value pointed to by GR2. GR3 would contain decimal 11 which is the length of the parm \"HELLO WORLD\". GR3 is decremented by 1, making it a length code. The actual parm value of \"HELLO WORLD\" begins 2 bytes past the address in GR2. The EX instruction executes the instruction at label MOVE which will move the parm to the storage at label PARM using the length code in R3. Macro reference SVC functions The following is a list of the z390 SVC services that support the macros.

Values from 0 to 4095. Displayed as abend Unnnn . DUMP A dump is always produced, overrides the NODUMP parm on ez390. All storage areas are dumped. Register Usage R1 = id and flags ESTAE, ESTAEX - Define Abend exit processing Info ESTAEX is provided for compatibility, only ESTAE is described here. name ESTAE label,type,PARAM= name ESTAE (reg),type,PARAM= name ESTAE 0 When a program abends, control is given to the label or address specified. Parameters 0 ESTAE 0 is used to cancel any previously established ESTAE routine. type Type is optional with default value of CT CT - adds a new exit OV - replaces an existing exit PARAM PARAM=label is optional PARAM=(reg) is optional When specified, the address of the label or the contents of the register are made available in the ESTAE control block at ESTAPARM. Exit invocation GR15 will contain the entry point, it is recommended that GR15 not be used as the base for the ESTAE routine. GR1 contains the address of the SDWA control block. The DSECT for the SDWA is generated by macro IHASDWA. This area may also be addressed by using the ZCVT. After processing the abend, several options are available: Cancel the exit and retry the failing instruction. Issue an ESTAE 0. Load GR0 with the address of the failing instruction, which is in the rightmost four bytes of the SDWA field SDWAEC1 and ensure that GR15=4, then return via BR R14. This will cancel the ESTAE and re-execute the instruction that caused the abend. If the instruction abends again, it will terminate the program. Sample code snippet: USING SDWA,R1 L R0,SDWAEC1+4 LA R15,4 BR R14 Enter a retry or cleanup routine. Place the retry address in GR0 and ensure GR15=4. If ESTAE 0 has not been issued, then the ESTAE routine remains active. Percolate through other recovery (ESTAE) routines. The current ESTAE routine is automatically cancelled. Set GR15=0 and return via BR R14. This will invoke previous recovery routines or abend the program. When percolate happens all LINK stack entries at a lower level than the latest ESTAE will be purged. Note In the z390 environment the abend code 0C5 may be caused by an internal error as well as a genuine addressing exception. If an abend occurs after the ESTAE exit is invoked and before ESTAE 0 or BR R14 are issued, then the program will be terminated. Register Usage R0 = exit address and flags R1 = parameter list R15= return code Return GR15 has a return code: 0 - ESTAE ok Abends SFFF - ESTAE stack exceeded ESPIE - Interrupt exit processing name ESPIE SET,addr,list,PARAM= name ESPIE SET,(reg),list,PARAM= name ESPIE RESET When a program interruption occurs eg. fixed point overflow, control is given to the label or address specified. Parameters RESET Will reset any previous ESPIE settings. list Set interupts that should be processed. If any of the codes 8, 10, 13 or 14 are specified, then the appropriate bit is set on in the PSW using the SPM instruction. The following interruption codes can appear in the list. 1 - operation 2 - privilege 3 - execute 4 - protection 5 - addressing 6 - specification 7 - data exception 8 - fixed point overflow (SPM mask bit X'8') 9 - fixed point divide 10 - decimal overflow (SPM mask bit X'4') 11 - decimal divide 12 - HFP exponent overflow 13 - HFP exponent underflow (SPM mask bit X'2') 14 - HFP significance (SPM mask bit X'1') 15 - HFP divide ESPIE SET,label,8 Single code ESPIE SET,label,(1,4,6) Multiple codes ESPIE SET,label,((2,6)) Range of codes: 2 through 6 ESPIE SET,label,(3,5,(7,9),14) Mixed codes: 3,5,7,8,9,14 PARAM (optional) PARAM=label PARAM=(reg) When specified the address of the label or the contents of the register are made available in the ESPIE control block. When the exit is invoked, GR1 contains the address of the EPIE control block. The macro IHAEPIE generates the DSECT for the EPIE. The EPIE control block is located in the ZCVT and may also be addressed by the ZCVT and EPIED macros. Note In the z390 environment, interruption code 5 may be caused by an internal error as well as a genuine addressing exception. Register Usage R0 = program mask R1 = exit address R15= parameter list SUBENTRY - Program entry name SUBENTRY CSECT=,BASES=,RENT=,RWA=,RWALNG=,STACK=,PSTACK=,PCHECK= Provides a standard entry for programs. Parameters name (optional) Although name is optional, care needs to be taken if it is omitted. A CSECT or sub-program should be named. CSECT= This is useful for setting up sub-programs within the main program that are invoked by the CALL macro. CSECT=YES (default) - Generates: name CSECT Standard entry. CSECT=NO - Generates: name DS 0D BASES= Override and extend the base registers for this program. Default BASES=(13) RENT Defines a re-entrant program. RENT=NO (default) A standard savearea is built, and GR13 is set as the default base register. This also serves as the pointer to the program's savearea to facilitate further linkage. The default base register GR13 may be overridden by the BASES= parameter (qv). It is recommended that the first register specified is GR13, if it isn't then a program is generated with non-standard linkage and may cause problems. RENT=YES The GETMAINed area described below is defined in the SUBENTRY macro. BASES= must be specified and the first register must not be GR13. Storage is GETMAINed and GR13 is set to the savearea within this storage. The STACK= parameter can generate multiple saveareas. The first register specified must NOT be 13. Each additional register generates the code and USING at the standard 4K intervals. eg. BASES=(13,7,8) will cover 12K of code. STACK=n Requires RENT=YES, default 0. Generates an addition to the GETMAINed area acquired allowing for multiple saveareas, each of these may have an additional read-only work area defined by RWALNG. RWA=dsectname (requires RENT=YES) RWA= defines the DSECT associated with this work area. RWALNG=n (requires RENT=YES, default 0) RWALNG defines the length of an additional work area to each savearea defined by STACK=. PSAVE Causes extra instructions to save and restore GR14 and GR15 registers. PSAVE=YES (default) - Save and restore GR14 and GR15 PSAVE=No - No save performed PSTACK=reg (requires RENT=YES, default=0) If PSTACK=0, then the user area address of each stack entry is stored at offset +80. Otherwise the user area address is not stored at offset +80, but loaded into the register specified. PCHECK (requires RENT=YES, default=YES) PCHECK=YES clears the stack area and sets the senior bit of the front and end pointers to 1. Register Usage R0,1,2,13,14,15 have multiple uses SUBEXIT - Program exit name SUBEXIT RC=returncode name SUBEXIT RC=(reg) Provides a standard exit for programs. If SUBENTRY used the parameter RENT=YES then the whole stack area will be FREEMAINed before GR15 is set. Parameters name (optional) RC will return the value in GR15, zero is the default. Register Usage All registers may be affected PERFORM or PM - Branch to local procedure name PERFORM procedure name PM procedure Generate a branch to a local procedure with base addressability. PERFORM and PM are identical macros. Uses MVC and B if SUBENTRY RENT=NO or push/pop stack if RENT=YES. Register Usage R14=Return address R15=Linkage register PENTRY - Define local procedure name PENTRY Define local procedure using name. Generates an entry-point for a local procedure preceded with a branch instruction if SUBENTRY RENT=NO. PEXIT - Exit local procedure name PEXIT Branch to last caller of local procedure. Generate branch to last PENTRY name address - 4. If SUBENTRY RENT=NO or generate decrement stack pointer, load, and branch if RENT=YES. Register Usage R14=Stack address R15=Saved linkage register EXIT - Return to last caller name EXIT Returns immediately to the last caller. No registers are restored. Use of SUBEXIT is preferred. Register Usage No registers affected EOJ (VSE only) name EOJ RC=returncode name EOJ RC=(reg) Returns immediately to the last caller. Parameters name is optional. RC will return the value in GR15, zero is the default. Register Usage R15= Return code CALL (list form) - Internal/external subroutine call name CALL ,(parm1,parm2,...),VL,MF=L Generates a parameter list for use with the execute form of CALL. name DC A(parm1,parm2...) Parameters (parm1,parm2,...) The parameters can be anything that is permitted in an A-type constant. Note that register forms like (R5) are not interpreted as general registers, but as constants. VL (optional) If the called program can accept a variable parameter list, then VL will turn on the senior bit (bit 0) of the last parameter. CALL (execute form) - Internal/external subroutine call name CALL routine,(parm1,parm2,...),VL,LINKINST=,MF=(E,parms) name CALL (reg),(parm1,parm2,...),VL,MF=(E,parms) Provides a standard internal or external subroutine call. Parameters Parameters are addressed by GR1 and linkage by GR14 routine. If a label, it can be internal (resolved at assembly time) or external (loaded and resolved by the linkage editor). If the routine is in register notation, it can be internal or separately loaded. (parm1,parm2,...) Modify a fixed or variable parameter list to be accessed by the called program. The parameter list must have initially been defined using the list form of the CALL. The parameters specified here will overlay that parameter list. It is important that the number of parameters specified here does not exceed those specified in the list form of the CALL. The parameters can be anything that is permitted in an A-type constant. Any parameters bounded by parentheses, eg. (R5) are assumed to be registers or register equates. The content of each register (fullword only) is stored at the parameter location. VL (optional) If the called program can accept a variable parameter list, then VL will turn on the senior bit (bit 0) of the last parameter. Note This is the last parameter in the modified parameter list. LINKINST= (optional) Determines the calling instruction. Choose BALR (default) or BASR. MF=(E,label) or MF=(E,(reg)) The label or register points to a parameter list previously defined with the list form of the CALL. Usage Call subroutine MYSUBR, replace the two parameters and mark the last parameter. MYCALL CALL MYSUBR,(8,MYDATA),VL,MF=(E,PARMS) ...... PARMS CALL ,(7,OLDDATA),VL,MF=L CALL (standard form) - Internal/external subroutine call name CALL routine,(parm1,parm2,...),VL,LINKINST=,MF=I name CALL (reg),(parm1,parm2,...),VL,LINKINST=,MF=I Provides a standard internal or external subroutine call. Parameters Parameters are addressed by GR1 and linkage by GR14 routine. If a label, it can be internal (resolved at assembly time) or external (loaded and resolved by the linkage editor). If the routine is in register notation, it can be internal or separately loaded. (parm1,parm2,...) (optional) Pass a fixed or variable parameter list to the called program. The parameters can be anything that is permitted in an A-type constant. Any parameters bounded by parentheses, eg. (R5) are assumed to be registers or register equates. The content of each register (fullword only) is stored at the parameter location. VL (optional) If the called program can accept a variable parameter list, then VL will turn on the senior bit (bit 0) of the last parameter. LINKINST= (optional) Determines the calling instruction. Choose BALR (default) or BASR. Usage Call subroutine MYSUBR, pass two parameters and mark the last parameter. MYCALL CALL MYSUBR,(8,MYDATA),VL Register Usage R0 = indirect parameter list R1 = parameter list R14= linkage R15= program location SAVE - Save registers name SAVE (fromreg,toreg) Saves the specified register range in the save area pointed to by GR13. The registers are saved in their conventional positions. RETURN - Restore registers name RETURN (fromreg,toreg),flag,RC= Restores the specified register range from the save area pointed to by GR13. The registers are restored from their conventional positions. Return is by the restored GR14. Parameters flag (optional) T specifies that the byte at savearea+15 has the junior bit (bit 7) turned on to indicate a return to a called program. This bit (rightmost bit of saved GR14) is set after GR14 has been loaded with the return address. RC=nn or RC=(reg) If RC is omitted, GR15 is assumed to contain the return code. GR15 is loaded with this return code before returning via GR14. RC may have a numeric value or the value may be in GRreg. Register Usage R15= Return code All registers in the range fromreg-toreg Usage MYRET RETURN (14,12),T,RC=12 Restore registers 14 through 12. After the register restore, flag the savearea to indicate return to caller and set return code to 12.

Additional information Use counts and parameter passing On the first invocation and after a LOAD , LINK or XCTL , the program receiving control has its use count incremented. When a program is DELETEd, it terminates or loses control via an XCTL, then the use count is decremented. When the use count is zero, the storage for that program is freed. When passing parameters it is important to consider whether those parameters are in a program whose storage may be reused. If in doubt, place parameters for passing on, in a separate GETMAINed area. Common program load parameters The following parameter descriptions apply to the LOAD , CDLOAD , DELETE , CDDELETE , LINK , XCTL and RESTORE macros. When a program is loaded (with suffix .390) then relocation takes place. EP, EPLOC, DDNAME and DSNAME are used to locate the program or module. EP, EPLOC and DE are mutually exclusive. DDNAME and DSNAME cannot both be present. EP=program Specify the program name, maximum 8 bytes. EPLOC=label or EPLOC=(reg) The label or the register must point to an 8-byte field containing the program name. DE=label or DE=(reg) The label or the register must point to a BLDL entry. In all the above cases as neither DDNAME nor DSNAME are specified, then the z390 search path is used. This may be overridden by the ez390 parameter SYS390. EP/EPLOC/DE and DDNAME=name or EP/EPLOC/DE and DDNAME=(reg) DDNAME has or points to the name of an environment variable. This variable may contain: The complete path and filename. In this case EP, EPLOC or DE are ignored. A single path. Only this path will be searched. Multiple paths separated by plus signs. All paths will be searched in the order specified. LINK EP=MYLINK,DDNAME=MYPATH ... For execution, define a script file setting the environment variable MYPATH Program specified with EP ignored SET MYPATH=c:\\path\\to\\390\\file.390 Single search path SET MYPATH=c:\\path\\to\\folder Multiple search paths SET MYPATH=c:\\path\\to\\dir1+c:\\path2 EP/EPLOC/DE and DSNAME=name or EP/EPLOC/DE and DSNAME=(reg) DSNAME is or points to a label defined in the program which has the file spec. The file spec must terminate with X'00' or be defined as a double-quoted string within the standard C-type constant. Either constant may contain: The complete path and filename. In this case EP, EPLOC or DE are ignored. A single path. Only this path will be searched. Multiple paths separated by semicolons or plus signs. All paths will be searched in the order specified. LINK EP=MYLINK,DSNAME=MYPATH ... ...... MYPATH DC C'c:\\path\\to\\file',X'00' MYPATH DC C'\"c:\\path1;c:\\path2\"' Note In the above cases where the filename is specified in the environment variable or the DC constant, then the .390 suffix should be omitted. The exceptions to this are LOAD and DELETE , which may be used to load or delete a non-program module and may have any suffix appended. PARAM= and VL= Only available on LINK and XCTL . Used for passing a fixed or variable parameter list to a program. PARAM=(parm1,parm2,...) The parameters can be anything that is permitted in an A-type constant. When the program is invoked GR1 points to the parameter list. See Use counts and parameter passing below for special considerations. VL=0 or VL=1 Default - VL=1 If the called program can accept a variable parameter list, then VL=1 will turn on the senior bit (bit 0) of the last parameter.","title":"Program Services"},{"location":"reference/program_services/#program-services","text":"","title":"Program Services"},{"location":"reference/program_services/#save-area-and-linkage-conventions","text":"Standard save area is defined as follows: DS 0CL72 DS F +0 reserved DS F +4 address of calling savearea DS F +8 address of called savearea DS 15F +12 callers GR14 through GR12 There are normally two save areas involved when a program is called by another program: The save area for the calling program -- the caller The save area for the called program -- the callee Upon entry to the called program, GR13 contains the address of the caller's save area. The callee: Saves GR14 to GR12 (registers at entry to the called program) at +12 of the caller's save area Obtains its own save area (the called program's save area) Stores the address of its save area at +8 of the caller's save area (caller's forward chain) Stores the address of the caller's save area (GR13 at entry) at +4 of its (the called program's) save area (called program's back chain) Loads GR13 with the address of its (the called program's) save area At this point the called program begins its processing. If it calls another program steps 1--5 are repeated; this time the \"caller\" is the current program and there is a new called program.

The advantage of using the SOA architecture is that services are more easily shared across diverse applications and user networks and maintenance is simpler since server code does not need to be statically linked into client application code. Any z390 application program can open up to 10 different client TCP/IP ports and 10 different TCP/IP server ports. The server can support up to a total of 20 concurrent connections from client. z390 TCP/IP client and server programs can interact with clients or server applications written in any language supporting compatible messaging via TCP/IP sockets. Macro reference SVC functions The z390 macro TCPIO invoking svc x\u20197C\u2019 supports TCP/IP sockets messaging between client and server components. TCPIO - TCP/IP operations The TCPIO macro operations OPEN, CLOSE, SEND, and RECEIVE support messaging between client and server programs using TCP/IP sockets. Messages of any length can be exchanges between any client and server programs on a TCP/IP network. The server program must first open a socket port. Up to 20 concurrent clients can open connections to any server port. The same program can have up to 10 server ports and 10 client ports open. This command is similar to the functions provided by the IBM z/OS Communication Server macro EZASMI OPEN label TCPIO OPEN,PORT=port,HOST=host The port can be any standard port number less than 1024 or any private port number above 1024. The port number can be numeric constant, symbolic absolute value, or can be specified in (register). The only requirement is that port numbers not conflict with other port numbers being used on the same network with the same processor hosts. If the HOST= keyword parameter is coded specifying a specific host IP address such as 162.692.1.3 or * for the current processor, then a client port will be opened with a connection to the server port on the indicated processor. If a connection to the specified server port cannot be made, then a return code of 12 will be set. If the HOST= parameter is omitted, then a server port will be opened on the current processor which can handle up to 20 concurrent connections from client ports on the network. CLOSE label TCPIO CLOSE,PORT=port Close the specified port. Info You cannot open a client and sever port with the same number so there is no need to indicate which type it is. When a server port is closed, all associated port and connection threads are also terminated. All ports are automatically closed at program termination if not closed explicitly. SEND label TCPIO SEND,PORT=port,MSG=addr,LMSG=length Send the message with specified address and length to the specified port. The message starting address can be RX type label or can be specified as (register). The message length can be absolute value or (register). If the send fails, a return code of 12 will be set. RECEIVE label TCPIO RECEIVE[,NOWAIT],PORT=port,MSG=addr,LMSG=max-length[,CONN=id] Receive a message from the specified port starting at address with length up to max length. The message starting address can be RX type label or can be specified as (register). The message maximum length can be absolute value or (register). If the optional second positional parameter NOWAIT is specified, a return code of 4 will be returned if no message is ready otherwise the RECEIVE will wait until at least 1 byte of the message is available. If the port is a server port then the optional keyword parameter CONN=id may be specified indicating a specific connection that was previously returned by prior TCPIO RECEIVE in register 2. If a CONN value of -1 is specified or the parameter is omitted, the next message from any connection will be returned along with the connection id in register 2. At least 1 byte will be returned on a successful RECEIVE with return code 0 along with the number of bytes returned in register 1. Up to the max-length bytes may be returned. If more than one message arrives prior to RECEIVE, it is up to the user to determine where one message ends and next message starts. A 4 byte message length prefix can be used to determine each message length. If passing ASCII text, use ending line feed character (hex x\u20190A\u2019). Note More than one RECEIVE operation may be required to retrieve an entire logical message since the TCP/IP network may not transfer the entire message in one packet on the network and a portion of the logical message may be ready whereas the next RECEIVE may have to wait for the next part of the message. The TCPIO service is not sensitive to any special characters and all byte values are allowed anywhere in messages. If any TCPIO operation fails for any reason on the client or server, a non-zero return code is returned. The TCPIO server port support includes multiple threads to support concurrent connections. There is one thread for each open server port which waits for new connections on the server port, starts new connection thread, and then returns to wait for another connection. Each connection thread waits for any current available messages to be read from that connection input buffer by the main TPCIO user thread. When all messages have been retrieved, then the connection thread issues a connection client socket read for first byte of the next input message. The connection thread will wait for the next message to arrive in the input buffer or for a disconnect. If a disconnect occurs, the connection thread is cancelled. If a pending RECEIVE is waiting on the connection which disconnected, a return code of 12 is returned. If the read of first byte is successful the thread returns to wait for the main TCPIO user thread to retrieve the full or partial message available in the connection input buffer. Since partial messages can arrive from multiple connections in any sequence, the server must be sure to retrieve a complete message from a specific connection prior to returning to non-specific RECEIVE for the next message. SOAGEN - SOA app gen support The macro SOAGEN can be used to generate customized client and server message managers plus stubs for each service called by the client application. In addition the SOAGEN macro generates two batch commands to build the SOA application and to execute the client server SOA application. The SOAGEN macro uses the z390 PUNCH extension operands DSNAME= and FORMAT to generate 3 or more source MLC files plus the two BAT files in one macro expansion execution. Parameters Parameter Usage Comments MAIN= name of main client program If specified, an assembly and link of the main program with the generated service call stubs will be generated. CTYPE=MLC/CBL define language type for client COBOL clients generate IBM standard EZASOKET calls to TCP/IP to connect to services. CLIENT= name of the generated client message manager called from stubs. SERVER= name of the generated service message manager which loads and calls services based on service request messages. HOST= IP address of server host processor or * for local processor PORT= port # for this application (must be greater than 1023) SERVICES= one or more sublists defining the name of each called service and the length of each parameter being passed to service. If the length is negative, that indicates the parameter is read only and the updated parameter will not be returned in response message. MACDIR= directory containing the SOAGEN macros GENDIR= directory to contain the generated source files and command files GENBLD= name of the generated build command file GENRUN= name of the generated run command file Usage SOAGEN MAIN=DEMOMAIN, MAIN CLIENT APPLICATION PGM X CLIENT=DEMOCMGR, SOA CLIENT MSG MGR NAME X SERVER=DEMOSMGR, SOA SERVER MSG MGR NAME X HOST=*, (192.168.1.3) HOST SERVER NAME (*=LOCAL) X PORT=3900, HOST SERVER PORT X SERVICES=((DEMOSUB1,-45,-45,45), SERVICES WITH PARM LENX (DEMOSUB2,-4,-4,4)), (NOTE -LENGTH FOR READ ONLY) X MACDIR=<z390_path>\\SOA\\MACLIB, SOA GEN MACRO DIRECTORY X GENDIR=<z390_path>\\SOA\\DEMO, DIRECTORY FOR SOA APPL X GENBLD=DEMOBLD, GENERATED BUILD BAT FILE X GENRUN=DEMORUN GENERATED RUN BAT FILE END The above SOA application generation macro call generates server message manager DEMOSMGR to run on the same host as client using HOST=*. To generate the same application to run server on a specific host, change the HOST= parameter to specify the IP address of the desired server. The above SOAGEN macro call generates the following source files using z390 PUNCH extended operands DSNAME= and FORMAT to control PUNCH output files: DEMOCMGR.MLC \u2013 source macro call to SOACMGR to generate SOA client message manager for the demo application. DEMOSMGR.MLC \u2013 source macro call to SOASMGR to generate SOA server message manager for the demo application. SOA_STUB_DEMOSUB1.MLC - source macro call to SOASTUB to generate SOA stub for DEMOSUB1 service call. SOA_STUB_DEMOSUB2.MLC \u2013 source macro call to SOASTUB to generate SOA stub for DEMOSUB2 service call. DEMOBLD.BAT \u2013 generated command file to build the SOA demo application. DEMORUN.BAT \u2013 generated command file to start the DEMOSMGR server on the same processor and then run the DEMOMAIN client application. Technical Notes The client message manager is generated using a call to the SOACMGR macro with the required parameters from the SOAGEN macro call. The client message manager performs the following functions when called from a client source call stub: On first call, dynamically allocate the required message buffer based on the maximum service message required. On first call open a TCP/IP socket connection to the server message manager using the port and IP address specified. Build a send message with message length, time stamp, service name, and all the parameters required by the service. Note the service can only access the parameters passed with the length specified. If a service needs to access additional parameters such as control blocks in memory, they need to all be passed to the service. Send the message from client to server message manager using specified port Wait for response from the server with matching time stamp and service name plus updated parameters, and return code from service. Note the generated client message manager has logic to issue more than 1 RECEIVE to fetch the entire variable length response message if necessary. Move the returned updated parameters to the original calling list addresses. exit to calling stub which exits to the calling client main application program. The server message manager is generated using a call to the SOASMGR macro with the required parameters from the SOAGEN macro call. The server message manager performs the following functions: Opens server socket for specified port which starts thread which listens for new connections from clients and starts new connection threads as required. The server port and listens for incoming messages from clients. Issues receive on the server port to receive all or part of a message from a client on an open connection. The server logic fetches at least 4 bytes and uses the message length in the first 4 bytes to determine how many bytes must be read to complete the variable length message which may require additional receive commands. Look up the service name specified. If service not found, an error is generated on server log and server returns to get next message. Build call parameter address less pointing to the parameters in the received message. Note this implies that all updates by the service will be made to parameter areas in the message buffer. Load the service on the first call and save entry address. Call the service to update parameters in the message buffer. Store the service return code in the message buffer. Build return message truncated to just the updated parameters as indicated by positive lengths in the SOAGEN SERVICES parameter. Send response message back to client message manager using same connection as request message. Return to wait for next service request message from any client connection. If client disconnect occurs, the disconnect is logged and server returns to wait for next request message from any other client connections. Stubs for each service name called by the client application are generated using calls to the macro SOASTUB. The functions performed by the generated stubs are: On first call load the client message manager and save address. Call the client message manager passing the name of the service and the calling parameter list. Upon return, exit to caller with return code. If the GENBLD parameter specifies a name, then the SOAGEN macro will generate a batch command file which assembles each of the above source programs to create an executable SOA type client server application. If the GENRUN parameter specifies a name, then the SOAGEN macro will generate a batch command to start the named SOA server message manager on the same processor, and then run the client application. If the HOST parameter specifies a different processor, the generated server message manager will need to be copied to that processor and started prior to running the client application. Demonstration z390 distribution includes soa directory with SOA generation macro library and a demo application which can be generated and executed as either a classic statically linked application or an SOA generated client server application using TCP/IP sockets.

The first positional macro parameter contains the operation code and options.

FIELDS Any number of key fields defined as FIELDS=(offset,length,type,order,{.repeat.}) Offset to start of key starts at 1 and cannot be greater than LRECL. For variable length records the offset does not include the 4 byte prefix. Length of key plus offset must not exceed LRECL Type of sort key field: AC - ASCII characters (same as CH) BI - unsigned binary (same as CH) CH - EBCDIC characters (same as CH) FI - signed binary such as half word, full word, or quad word integers FL - floating point HFP, BFP, or DFP short, long, or extended PD - packed decimal ZD - zoned decimal Order A - Ascending D - Descending LRECL Length of record (may be maximum length of variable length records). MEMORY Amount of memory available for sort table. If no value is specified, the maximum available contiguous memory block within the memory allocated to step by MEM option will be used. Execute format Alternatively the execute form MF=(E,addr) can be used. See linklib\\SORT.MLC for example. Technical details zSORT is implemented via SVC x'A1' which has 3 function calls: initialize internal sort request submit unsorted record retrieve sorted records. Unsorted records are loaded into a dynamically allocated table in memory and sorted. If the unsorted records exceed the size of the table, then multiple blocks of sorted records are written to a work file and then merged. If all the records fit in the table, then they are sorted and returned without requiring use of sort work files. When required, the merging is performed using two dynamically allocated sort work files with DDNAME's SORTWK01 and SORTWK02. The sorted strings are merged from one work file to another doubling the size of the sorted strings on each pass until all the records are sorted on last merge pass. All file I/O is blocked to minimize disk seeking on single disk systems. User can define the location of SORTWK01 and SORTWK02 if multiple physical disk drives are available.

MAREA MLEN RLSREAD SHRPOOL OPEN - Open cluster label OPEN (entry[,entry]...), MODE=, MF=, The open macro is used to open one or more clusters and/or one or more sequential files in a single call. A cluster needs to be opened before it can be processed. Parameters entry - ACB/DCB address addr[,options],[...] The OPEN macro accepts a list of entries. Each entry consists of two consecutive parameters, address and options. addr - Address of ACB or DCB The address can be specified as an A-type address or as a register. If a register is coded the register number or name must be enclosed in parentheses. The address can be either the address of a DCB or the address of an ACB options For DCB, options may be encoded according to the z390 File Services . For ACB, options list is ignored and should be coded as an omitted parameter. For ACB's, all options are taken from the ACB, not the open parm list. Open parameter list entries have two different formats depending on the MODE parameter. MODE=24 AL1(option),AL3(DCB/ACB address) R1 points to the list. MODE=31 AL1(option),XL3'00',AL4(DCB/ACB address) R0 points to the list and R1=0. Available option values: INPUT - X'40' OUTPUT - X'20' UPDATE - X'60' The last entry has the X'80' bit on in option. MF - Parm Available options: option effect MF=I or omitted An open parmlist is generated inline, plus a call to the OPEN SVC using the parmlist. MF=L An open parmlist is generated inline. MF=(E,addr) Code to modify/populate the open parameter list at the indicated address, which may be a relocatable constant or a (register), plus a call to the OPEN SVC using the parmlist. MODE - Residence mode Residency mode of all control blocks involved. MODE=24 - Use below the line only MODE=31 (Default) - if any resides above the line.

ZPARTRS User Guide The program zpar\\ZPARTRS.MLC reads the linker listing LST file for every z390 load module executed in the trace via LINK, LOAD, or XCTL in order to find the PRN file for every included module in each load module. If LOADLIB(path) is specified, all the LST and PRN files will be loaded from that directory otherwise the LST files will be loaded from path specified in the TRE trace for each LOAD svc, and the PRN files will be loaded from the path specified on the INCLUDE statements in each LST file. If no INCLUDE option is specified, the first loaded program is the only program source traced. The source code for each statically linked PRN is loaded into memory and cross referenced to the PSW-ADDR corresponding to current load address using HLASM created macro variables which store source code by PSW address name. Note the same source program may be loaded multiple times at different addresses during execution. The output source trace file is created with same path and name as TRE file but with suffix TRS. If no corresponding PRN source line is found when generating all assembler, the original TRE instruction trace line with opcode and operands is generated instead as message. This can occur due to missing LST or PRN files or due to generation of instructions using DC hex values for multiple instructions, use of ORG to overlay instructions, etc. Source assembler lines PSW-ADDR - instruction PSW trace address with high bit indicating 31 or 24 bit AMODE from TRE file PSW-CC - condition code at start of instruction from TRE file MODULE-NAME - source module name included in 390 load module (case sensitive) MOD-ADDR - relative module address from PRN listing LINE - source assembler line with comments Source COBOL lines LINE # - line number of source statement MOD_NAME - source module name included in 390 load module (case sensitive) LINE - COBOL or EXEC CICS source line with comments (note assembler EXEC CICS lines show up as ECA= instead of CBL=) ZPARTRS Debugging Tips on debugging problems with ZPARTRS: The generated TRS file contains all the generated error messages starting with ERR=. These messages also appear on the zpar\\zpartrs.err log as mnotes with 4, 8, or 16 error level. The total error count and max level is displayed at end of report. The zpartrs return code is set to highest MNOTE error level. The file zpar\\ZPARTRS.OPT contains default options. You can turn on TRACEM to generate apar\\ZPARTRS.TRM trace file to help debug any conditional macro errors occurring. Note this really slows down the execution so cut down test TRE files are best. INCLUDE and EXCLUDE are mutually exclusive so only specify one or the other. If no source code is found in an included PRN file, an error is generated. This can occur if the PRN listing has PRINT NOGEN or PRINT OFF. ZPARTRS is dependent on PRN file containing source code listing with zcobol statement comments (*ZC) and/or assembler instruction listing.

ASCII AE NO Generate ASCII versus EBCDIC DC character constants, compare character strings in ASCII versus EBCDIC in macro processor, generate ASCII versus EBCDIC output for UNPK, ED, and EDMK. Note ASCII mode is not mainframe compatible and requires careful review of program to insure no EBCDIC immediate compare constants such as X'40', 64, X'F0', 240 etc. are used and that there are no assumptions about EBCDIC versus ASCII collating sequences which have numbers and letters reversed, and EBCDIC letters are non-contiguous. Typically HLASM compatible programs are run in default EBCDIC mode and DCB RECFM=FT|VT or some other translation option is used to convert between EBCDIC and ASCII where necessary. Note there are a few instructions affected by ASCII mode: 1) ED/EDMK generate ASCII versus EBCDIC but the mask must always be in EBCDIC (masks are usually coded in X'...' format) 2) UNPK generates X'3' versus X'F' in zone field (high order nibble).

Note this should detect any EBCDIC literal character strings containing non-ASCII characters such as binary 0 byte which must be changed to hex X'00' type strings for portability. CICS MA NO Support EXEC CICS pre-processor expansion and constants. If this option is not on during macro expansion, PROLOG and EPILOG option settings will be ignored. CODEPAGE(ascii+ebcdic+LIST) MALE YES The default is CODEPAGE(ISO-8859-1+IBM1047). If +LIST is added the mapping of the 2 codepages along with printable character and Unicode values are displayed on ERR file.

TIME or TIME(seconds) MALE YES Limit execution time of each program to the number of seconds specified. The default is 15 seconds. This option is turned off if NOTIMING specified. Use NOTIME to allow tasks such as SOA servers like z390CICS to run continuously while still supporting application use of timing functions. TIMING MALE YES Calculate elapsed time and instructions per second statistics for display on START/END messages and STA statistics. TIMING also displays current z390 and J2SE version on start message and memory usage on ended message. Note NOTIMING is used in regression tests to force generated files to be identical by using fixed data/time stamp using GregorianCalendar(2005,0,2,22,33,44). NOTIMING suppresses versions on start message and memory usage on ended message. NOTIMING also sets NOTIME which prevents application from using time functions. TRACE or TRACE(AEGILMPQTV) E NO Turn on ez390 execution trace generation on TRE file and turn off CON. TRACE will display every instruction executed along with address and value of each operand. Any combination of the following trace options can be set using the TRACE(...) option. TRACE(*) will also set TRACEALL.

VCB E YES Generate VSAM cache buffer for improving VSAM performance by storing most recently accessed records and indexes. WRITENONPRINTABLE MA NO Write non-printable characters to PRN, BAL and PCH files. The default value NOWRITENONPRINTABLE replaces all non-printable characters with the '.' character. This avoids issues caused by writing control characters such as 0x0A (Line Feed) or 0x0D (Carriage Return). XREF A YES Cross reference symbols to source lines in PRN assembly listing. ZSTRMAC M YES Support expansion of ZSTRMAC structured conditional macro code instructions during loading of MLC, MAC, and CPY files. Note z390 macros in z390\\mac directory now are using zstrmac for structured coding. NOZSTRMAC can only be used with MVS, VSE, or other non-structured macro libraries. ZVSAM E 0 ZVSAM 0=no vsam, 1=zvsam1 support, 2=zvsam2 support.","title":"z390 Options"},{"location":"user_guide/z390/z390_options/#z390-options","text":"The scope value details where the option is used. M - mz390 macro processor which reads ASCII assembler source and generates expanded BAL A - az390 assembler which reads BAL and generated OBJ relocatable object code L - lz390 linker which reads OBJ relocatable object files and generates 390 load module E - ez390 emulator runtime which loads and executes 390 load module Use of parameters with parentheses in *nix shells Unix shells like sh and bash interpret parentheses if not quoted. For this reason, if you need to specify a parameter that contains parentheses, then that parameter should be quoted. For example, the SYSMAC parameter is quoted as it uses parentheses, whereas the ALIGN parameter is not. \"SYSMAC(foldername)\" ALIGN Option Scope Default Description @filename MALE Options in Z390.OPT file if found. Retrieve additional options from free form text file with default suffix OPT. Options can be specified delimited by spaces on as many lines as required. All characters on a line following * are ignored as comments. The @file option can be nested. The default path is the program path. If a file named Z390.OPT exists in the z390 install directory, these options will be applied first as default options. ALIGN A YES Align DS/DC data fields based on type unless explicit length is specified. If duplication factor is 0, then NOALIGN is ignored. ALLOW M NO Allow extensions to HLASM syntax including: 1) No quotes required for SETC variables. 2) Duplication factor does not require (..). 3) Array declarations with variables in expression accepted 4) Substring starting beyond end returns null string 5) Quoted strings allowed in SETA and SETB expressions 6) Allow &var as null string if not found during substitution 7) Allow duplicate local and global variable declarations 8) Allow AREAD and PUNCH file records greater than 80 characters. The default of NOALLOW insures HLASM compatibility. AMODE24 LE NO Set 390 load module options to start in 24 bit address mode. AMODE31 LE YES Set 390 load module options to start in 31 bit address mode. ASCII AE NO Generate ASCII versus EBCDIC DC character constants, compare character strings in ASCII versus EBCDIC in macro processor, generate ASCII versus EBCDIC output for UNPK, ED, and EDMK. Note ASCII mode is not mainframe compatible and requires careful review of program to insure no EBCDIC immediate compare constants such as X'40', 64, X'F0', 240 etc. are used and that there are no assumptions about EBCDIC versus ASCII collating sequences which have numbers and letters reversed, and EBCDIC letters are non-contiguous. Typically HLASM compatible programs are run in default EBCDIC mode and DCB RECFM=FT|VT or some other translation option is used to convert between EBCDIC and ASCII where necessary. Note there are a few instructions affected by ASCII mode: 1) ED/EDMK generate ASCII versus EBCDIC but the mask must always be in EBCDIC (masks are usually coded in X'...' format) 2) UNPK generates X'3' versus X'F' in zone field (high order nibble). ASM MA YES Run az390 assembler as subtask of mz390 passing BAL. Note NOASM is for use in pure text processing programs which only use conditional macro code and AREAD/PUNCH with extensions to process ASCII text files. NOASM does not support ordinary symbol attribute tests, OPSYN, or lookahead mode, and requires CHKMAC(0) and CHKSRC(0-2).

CHKSRC(0-3) MA 1 Check input source files as follows: 0 - no checking 1 - check MLC or BAL input source files for any non-ASCII characters and issue error 2 - check MLC, MAC, CPY, and BAL input source files for any non-ASCII characters and issue error. 3 - also check for out of sequence characters in 73-80 or any non-blank characters beyond 80 and issue error. Note this should detect any EBCDIC literal character strings containing non-ASCII characters such as binary 0 byte which must be changed to hex X'00' type strings for portability. CICS MA NO Support EXEC CICS pre-processor expansion and constants. If this option is not on during macro expansion, PROLOG and EPILOG option settings will be ignored. CODEPAGE(ascii+ebcdic+LIST) MALE YES The default is CODEPAGE(ISO-8859-1+IBM1047). If +LIST is added the mapping of the 2 codepages along with printable character and Unicode values are displayed on ERR file. A hex dump of the tables and a list of the valid ASCII and EBCDIC Unicode Charset codepages are listed. You can replace the EBCDIC codepage name with a file specification such as IBM1047.HCP (example included) which is in hex dump format. The above defaults match z/OS. CON MALE YES Console output for all start/stop, error, trace, MNOTE's with level > 4, and WTO messages. When the TRACE??? option is specified, the CON option is turned off so only start/stop and abort error messages appear on console log.

ERRSUM M NO Generate critical error summary on console and ERR file listing missing macros and copybooks. This option requires ASM option and is turned on automatically if missing macros or copybooks are found in the executed macro code path. When ERRSUM is on, ERR(0) is set to prevent abort prior to finding all macro and copybook references. All errors are listed on ERR file along with summary report. Note several iterations may be required to identify and resolve all missing macros and copybooks. GUAM E NO Support one or more GUI Graphical User Access Method dialogs for MCS, TN3270, or graphics user interface. INIT E YES Initialize all registers to hex x'F4', all memory to hex x'F5', and all uninitialized load module areas to x'F6' for easier identification of access to uninitialized registers, memory or program fields.

MCALL A NO List each macro call and exit on the PRN assembly listing in addition to first level calls if LISTCALL option is also on. MEM(1) E 1 Memory allocated for 390 program execution in MB. Note for RMODE31 loads and GETMAIN's memory above the 16 MB line must be allocated. For example MEM(32) would provide 16 MB below the line and 16 MB above. MINHEIGHT(150) E 150 Minimum pixel height for GUI dialog windows. MINWIDTH(150) E 150 Minimum pixel width for GUI dialog windows. MNOTE(0) MA 0 Control MNOTE error/warning messages during macro expansion and assembly: 0 - default generates MNOTE error/warning during mz390 and az390 1 - suppress mz390 error/warning and only pass MNOTE to az390 2 - generates MNOTE error/warning during mz390 and suppresses passing them on to az390.

If you create your own zCICS applications, it would be wise to create a .BAT file that re-assembles them all in one go. The internal interfaces are volatile at present and this will be a frequent instruction. The current zCICS environment and all test programs can be re-assembled using DFHALL.BAT. The test VSAM catalog and files can be rebuilt using DFHALLV.BAT. Assembly notes The CICS option must be used when executing mz390 command. PROLOG and EPILOG are defaults. NOEPILOG is supported but not fully tested, testing and correct usage is scheduled for a future release of zCICS. PROLOG inserts the following: DFHEISTG Define the prefix areas of the Dynamic Storage Area (DSA). DFHEIEND Replaces the END statement and defines the end of the DSA. DFHEIENT Replaces the first CSECT statement Establish linkage and base registers GETMAIN the DSA Establish addressability to the EIB and TCTTE Some COMMAREA management Other macros DFHEIBLK - EIB DSECT DFHPCT - Transaction definition DFHFCT \u2013 File definitions and options EXEC - Converts EXEC CICS statements into a unique macro call with a parameter list DFHREGS \u2013 A synonym for EQUREGS Copy books DFHAID - Standard CICS equates for AID keys DFHBMSCA - Mapping support equates DFHPCTUS - User transaction codes DFHFCTUS - User file definitions Inclusion of the macro DFHREGS/EQUREGS is mandatory. Register Usage R0 - Reserved for internal use R1 - Reserved for internal use R10 - TCTTE address, must not be modified R11 - EIB address, must not be modified R12 - Default base register R13 - DSA address, must not be modified R14 - Reserved for internal use R15 - Reserved for internal use Multiple base registers (assembler only) The standard entry for a CICS program is as follows: e.g. DFHEISTG DSECT MYFIELD DS CL100 demo user field ...... MYPROG CSECT This standard method with the PROLOG option (default) will generate a single code base of R12 and a single DSA base of R13. If you want to extend the code base and/or the DSA base registers, convert your code in line with the sample given and include the NOPROLOG option in mz390 command. e.g. DFHEISTG MYFIELD DS CL100 demo user field ...... MYPROG DFHEIENT CODEREG=(R8,R5),DATAREG=(R13,R6,R7) Note You cannot override the first DATAREG value, it will always be R13. i.e. if you code DATAREG=(R6,R7) you will get DATAREG=(R13,R7) . There is no cross-checking for register conflicts. Assembler EXEC CICS command syntax There is no formal definition of an EXEC CICS command in any IBM CICS\u00ae Manual. These assembler syntaxes are currently supported. In-line space separated name EXEC CICS function subfunction parm parm() In-line comma separated name EXEC CICS function,subfunction,parm,parm(), parm () Split, space separated Non-blank in column 72 is assumed for all lines except the last. Comments are only allowed following a dot or comma delimiter on the last line. name EXEC CICS function X subfunction X parm X parm() parm (). a nice comment Split, comma separated Comments are allowed on all lines that end with comma+space. name EXEC CICS function, some X subfunction, very X parm, nice X parm(),parm (), comments name is supported and optional. EXEC CICS is expected, EXECUTE CICS is not currently supported. subfunction is optional and depends on the function but must follow function, e.g. EXEC CICS WRITEQ TS parm() without spacing and parm () with spacing are allowed. VSAM support See the zCICS VSAM Guide for guidance in the setup of a VSAM environment. This document also contains extensions to the VSAM facilities currently available. Basic Mapping Support The EXEC CICS commands RECEIVE MAP , SEND MAP and SEND CONTROL are documented here. For general BMS documentation and the mapping macros DFHMSD, DFHMDI and DFHMDF see the zCICS BMS Guide . zCOBOL support EXEC CICS command format follows the rules for COBOL. Each command must end END-EXEC (a following dot may affect the logic). Parameters like SET() which address imported structures may use the ADDRESS OF special register. LENGTH , FLENGTH and KEYLENGTH which would normally allow a numeric option may use the LENGTH OF special register. Extra Parameters You can add NOEDF to any EXEC CICS command if you wish that command to be excluded from a CEDF session. You can add NOEDF to the mz390 command if you wish all CEDF intercepts in that program excluded.

Each COBOL verb becomes a macro call opcode and all the words following up to the next verb or period become positional parameters for the macro call. Periods generate a PERIOD macro call to terminate all structures which may be missing the optional END-IF type words. All dashes in words are converted to underscores unless in quotes. The level numbers in data division statements are mapped to WS macro call with level as first positional operand. The macros in COBOL verb macro library zcobol/*.mac parse the parameters for each verb, access global macro symbol table, and call code generation macros to generated executable code. For example the IF macro issues calls to GEN_COMP macro to generate executable source code to compare two fields, and issues call to GEN_BC to generate executable source code to branch on condition. There are currently 4 optional zCOBOL executable code generation macro libraries. The zcobol/z390 HLASM code generation library is the primary focus currently. There is a COBOL demo program zcobol/demo/HELLO.CBL which can be compiled and executed in all 4 different target language environments using the initial zCOBOL release. The following libraries are available: zcobol/z390 - zCOBOL code generation macros for HLASM native z9/10 code zcobol/java - zCOBOL code generation macros for J2SE Java zcobol/vce - zCOBOL code generation macros for MS Visual Express C++ zcobol/i586 - zCOBOL code generation macros for HLA and MASM native Intel code Once the z390 HLASM code generation macros are complete and all the NIST COBOL 1985 standards tests have been completed successfully as a first milestone, then these macros can be copied to the other libraries and modified to replace HLASM source code model statements with the other target language statements. zc390 Translator The zc390 translator is a java regular expression based parser which reads COBOL source program and generates HLASM compatible mainframe assembler source program in one pass. Each recognized COBOL verb starts a new assembler macro call statement with all the parameters up to the next verb, period, or paragraph label passed as positional parameters. Periods generate a separate macro call to PERIOD to generate end to all the structures in the previous sentence. Paragraph and section labels generate call to LABEL with the name and type of label to generate. All hyphens in names are translated to underscores for HLASM compatibility. COBOL Language Verb Macros All the macros for the COBOL language verbs and section headings are stored in the macro library zcobol/mac . These macros parse the parameters, validate them for any syntax errors, and issue calls to generation macros in separate directory as described below. For example, the zcobol/mac/IF.MAC macro generates multiple calls to the generation macros GEN_COMP , GEN_BC , GEN_B , and GEN_LABEL . There are no language specific code generation macros in the zCOBOL directory so it is shared across multiple target language environments. All the macros are written in structured form using the z390 ZSTRMAC SPE structured programming extensions such as AIF, AELSEIF, AELSE, AEND, AWHILE, etc. As a result there are no explicit AGO or AIF labels in these macros. See Structured Macro Entensions documentation for more details. COMPUTE Statement Example The COBOL compute statement is a good example to study to understand how the zCOBOL compiler works. The steps followed to compile the following MOVE and COMPUTE statements are as follows: 77 FLT - SRT USAGE FLOAT-SHORT OCCURS 2 . MOVE 1 . 1 TO FLT-SRT ( 2 ). COMPUT E FLT-SRT ( 2 ) = FLT-SRT ( 2 ) + 2 . 2 . zc390 translator generates the following 2 zCOBOL verb macro call statements: MOVE 1 . 1 , 'TO' , FLT_SRT , \"(',2,')'` COMPUT E FLT_SRT , '(' , 2 , ')' , = , FLT_SRT , '(\",2,' ) ',+,2.2 The MOVE macro uses shared copybook routine GET_FIELD_PARM to parse the two fields for MOVE and store resulting field name and symbol table index. For the literal 1.1 the index is 0, for the subscripted field, the name is set to explicit register reference including length offset(length,register) and the code is generated to set the register to address of the subscripted field. The MOVE macro next issues call to GEN_MOVE with the source and target field names and system table indexes. The GEN_MOVE macro checks the type of each field and generates appropriate code to move value from source to target field. In this case it uses LARL to set register to address of DFP short value of 1.1 in literal table and then generates MVC to move the literal to the target subscripted field. The COMPUTE uses GET_FIELD_PARM to obtain name and index of target field and then extracts parms in expression following the = and then calls ZC_CALC macro to generate code for expression and store result in specified target field. This macro can be used by IF and other verb macros to calculate expression for loop etc. The ZC_CALC macro parses the expression parameters into Backus Normal Form using two stacks. One stack has the operators in expression and the other has the field parm index pointers. Following the rules of precedence, the operators and associated parameter pointers are removed from the stacks and stored sequentially in an operation table containing the operators, 2 operands, and the target field for each operation. Temporary storage fields are represented using negative indexes instead of position and a table of temporary fields created along with their type is maintained. A queue of free temporary fields is maintained and once a temporary field has been used in an operation, that temporary field is on the free queue for reuse rather than allocating a new temporary storage field. Once the expression has been parsed and all the operation table entries have been generated, the last target field is replaced with the result field passed to ZC_CALC and then the operation table is scanned and the generation macros for each operation are called to generate code to perform the operation. Just prior to generating code for an operation, the two input parameter types are used to determine the required type of result to minimize any loss of precision during the calculations. A call to GEN_MOVE is made to move the first operand field to the target field prior to performing add, subtract, etc. on the target field for operation. If the first operand is the same as the target field, the move can be omitted but that is not always possible to determine in the case of subscripting and indexing where different variables may just happen to have the same value. The called generation macros GEN_ADD, GEN_SUB, GEN_MPY, and GEN_DIV check the field types and perform the necessary conversion when types do not match. See demo added in zcobol/demo/callcomp directory which contains CALLCALC.MLC main assembler program which calls subroutine COMPSUM.CBL which uses COMPUTE statement to calculate sum of 15 different numeric data field types and returns sum as packed decimal for editing and display by calling program. There is a paper about this demo here: zcobol_COMPUTE.pdf -- Dead link zCOBOL Target Source Language Generation Macros All the target source language generation macros called by the COBOL verb macros in z390/zcobol are stored in the following directories by target language: Directory Notes zcobol/z390 Generate HLASM compatible mainframe assembler source program zcobol/java Generate J2SE java compatible source program zcobol/vce Generate MS Visual Express C compatible source program zcobol/i586 Generate HLA/MASM Intel assembler compatible source program Current only the z390 HLASM compatible source generation macros are being fully developed along with the required runtime support functions stored in the zcobol/lib/ZC390LIB.390 dynamically loaded runtime module. zCOBOL demos include a hello world COBOL program which can be compiled and executed in each of the target environments form the same zcobol/demo/HELLO.CBL source program.

Melvyn Maltz is currently developing additional EXEC CICS support for zCOBOL programs. ZC390LIB Runtime Library The zcobol\\lib code generation macro directory also contains all the source code and the ZC390CVT.CPY copybook required to build the linklib\\ZC390LIB.390 runtime load module which is dynamically loaded by all generated z390 zCOBOL programs. This module contains the following components: The ZC390CVT.CPY copybook is used in every zCOBOL generated program to define the DSECT addressed by register 9. The same copybook is also used in ZC390LIB.MLC to generate the CVT at the beginning of the ZC390LIB.390 runtime load module with addresses of all the entries followed by work areas used by the code generation macros. Library Element Notes ZC390LIB.MLC Contains ZC390LIB CSECT and COPY ZC390CVT to include all object modules following the CVT at the beginning ZC390NUC.MLC Included module with system function routines such as CALL, GOBACK, STOPRUN, PERFORM, and PMCHECK to check for end of current performed paragraph or section ABORT.MLC Contains module called to abort execution with reason code ACCEPT.MLC Contains support for ACCEPT date, time, day of week DISPLAY.MLC Display any type field or literal INSPECT.MLC Inspect field tallying, replacing, or transforming Base Free Code Generation The zCOBOL code generation macros in zcobol/lib generate base free code for the procedure division using relative instructions for both branch addressing and for literal addressing as required. The only address constants generated in zCOBOL programs are for statically linked CALL's to other zCOBOL or assembler programs. The only limit on the combined size of working storage and the procedure division is 16MB. In order to use relative addressing for literals, all odd length literals are padded to even lengths. The LARL instruction is used to set address of data field or literal field as required for use in following RX type instructions. To address working storage and linkage section data fields, conventional base registers are dynamically allocated as required for use in RX type instructions. Since R13 always points to the beginning of working-storage, no dynamic base registers are required for access to data items in the first 4K of working storage. zCOBOL EXEC CICS Support When the option CICS is specified on the command line for ZC390C, ZC390CL, or ZC390CLG, then the zcobol\\ZCOBOL MAC global option &ZC_CICS is set on and the following changes in code generation are made: The CICS option will generate call to DFHEIENT to initialize CICS prior to executing user code starting at the first program CSECT. A DFHEISTG DSECT is generated at the beginning of working-storage instead of WSLOC LOCTR and warnings are generated for any data VALUE clauses defined in working-storage section. zCOBOL Data Types The zCOBOL option FLOAT(HEX/BINARY/DECIMAL) can be used to change the default from DECIMAL to HEX or BINARY for the generic types FLOAT-SHORT, FLOAT-LONG, and FLOAT-EXTENDED. 2 COMP-3 packed and also zoned decimal are limited to 18 digits per COBOL standard unless option EXTEND is set allowing up to 31 digits for both packed decimal and zoned decimal fields.

Since R13 always points to the beginning of working-storage, no dynamic base registers are required for access to data items in the first 4K of working storage.","title":"Base Free Code Generation"},{"location":"user_guide/zCOBOL/zCOBOL_System_Programmer_Guide/#zcobol-exec-cics-support","text":"When the option CICS is specified on the command line for ZC390C, ZC390CL, or ZC390CLG, then the zcobol\\ZCOBOL MAC global option &ZC_CICS is set on and the following changes in code generation are made: The CICS option will generate call to DFHEIENT to initialize CICS prior to executing user code starting at the first program CSECT.

Overview zCOBOL is an open source portable mainframe COBOL compiler available as part of the z390 open source portable mainframe assembler. The zCOBOL compiler has been developed as a flexible tool for testing and modernizing COBOL applications without requiring rewriting existing programs. Getting Started First, you will need to install z390 Next, try the zCOBOL Quickstart which walks through how to create and run your first zCOBOL program. You can compile and run the provided HELLO COBOL program by using the following command: Windows cblclg zcobol\\demo\\HELLO MacOS/Unix cblclg zcobol/demo/HELLO The above command uses the zCOBOL to HLASM compile, link, and execute command to compile the COBOL hello world program HELLO.CBL into an executable HLASM compatible assembler program HELLO.MLC which is assembled using zCOBOL macro libraries zcobol+zcobol\\z390 and linked into z390 executable load module HELLO.390 which is then executed to generate WTO display of \"Hello World\" on the display log and on the console log file HELLO.LOG . Running your program You can compile, link, and execute a COBOL program in any directory by specifying the path and name of the program in the cblclg command. The source COBOL program must be in ASCII format and have the extension of CBL . Use the compiler command cblc to compile to relocatable object form. Use the compiler command cblcl to compile and link to 390 load module form with statically linked z390 and/or zCOBOL programs included. Once the programs have been successfully linked, then you can use the z390 exec command to execute a load module. For more about all the options available for z390 executable programs see the z390 User Guide Debugging your program Once you have successfully compiled a COBOL program into a z390 load module, you can run it with the command EXEC <filename> . If the program aborts or fails to produce the expected results, the next step is to debug the problem. The zCOBOL option TRACE can be specified to generate a WTO display of the name of each COBOL paragraph when it is entered. Along with listing of the program, this is sometimes enough to figure out why the program did not work. If it is necessary to examine the generated HLASM compatible assembler code, there are several steps that can be taken: First the assembly listing with suffix PRN produced by the zCOBOL compiler can be examined to see if the generated assembler instructions to perform the correct operation specified in the COBOL statement which precedes the generated code as a comment statement. See zcobol/demo/HELLO.PRN as an example. Next an execution trace of every assembler instruction executed along with the data values associated with each instruction can be produced by adding the option TRACE(E) which results in file with TRE suffix. If you also specify TRACE option, the WTO for every paragraph will also appear in the TRE trace file which can be handy for finding the start of code in a particular paragraph. For example, if you run the command cblclg zcobol/demo/POWERS TRACE(E) then you can view the resulting executing trace file zcobol/demo/POWERS.TRE as well as the log file zcobol/demo/POWERS.LOG . If the execution trace fails to pinpoint the problem, another option is to include debug test and display statements in the program to further isolate where the problem is occurring. zCOBOL demos and regression tests To run all the zCOBOL demo programs, you can execute the script runcbldemos (located in bash and bat folders) which will compile and execute them. You can then view the log file for each demo program to see the output produced. You can also run all the zCOBOL regression tests using the command runcbltests (located in bash and bat folders) and look at the source code and generated output.
