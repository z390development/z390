See note following this table. ASM MA YES Run az390 assembler as subtask of mz390 passing BAL. Note NOASM is for use in pure text processing programs which only use conditional macro code and AREAD/PUNCH with extensions to process ASCII text files. NOASM does not support ordinary symbol attribute tests, OPSYN, or lookahead mode, and requires CHKMAC(0) and CHKSRC(0-2). ASSIST MAE NO Enable assembly and execution of ASSIST I/O and debugging instructions. This option also sets NOLOADHIGH. See ASSIST Support. AUTOLINK L YES Search for unresolved external references in SYSOBJ directory list which defaults to linklib. BAL M NO Generate BAL expanded assembler source file. BS2000 MA NO Support Siemens BS2000 assembler global variables. CHKMAC(0-2) M 0 Check macros during loading. See note below this table for details. CHKSRC(0-3) MA 1 Check input source files. See note below this table for details. CICS MA NO Support EXEC CICS pre-processor expansion and constants. If this option is not on during macro expansion, PROLOG and EPILOG option settings will be ignored. CODEPAGE MALE CODEPAGE(ISO-8859-1+IBM1047) Values: ebcdic+ascii[+LIST]. If +LIST is added the mapping of the 2 codepages along with printable character and Unicode values are displayed on ERR file. A hex dump of the tables and a list of the valid ASCII and EBCDIC Unicode Charset codepages are listed. You can replace the EBCDIC codepage name with a file specification such as IBM1047.HCP (example included) which is in hex dump format. The above defaults match z/OS. CON MALE YES Console output for all start/stop, error, trace, MNOTE's with level &gt; 4, and WTO messages. When the TRACE??? option is specified, the CON option is turned off so only start/stop and abort error messages appear on console log. You can specify CON after last TRACE option to turn it back on if you want all display, trace, and error messages displayed on console log. All the trace messages appear on corresponding TR? file for each z390 program executed. DUMP E NO Generate full memory dump on LOG or TRE if abort. EDF M YES CICS Execution Diagnostic Facility. EPILOG M YES Generate epilog macro call DFHEIEND for CICS program at END statement if CICS option and EPILOG option are on. ERR(100) MALE 100 Terminate process if total errors for program exceeds limit. Use ERR(0) to eliminate any error limit and always generate PRN file. ERRSUM M NO Generate critical error summary on console and ERR file listing missing macros and copybooks. This option requires ASM option and is turned on automatically if missing macros or copybooks are found in the executed macro code path. When ERRSUM is on, ERR(0) is set to prevent abort prior to finding all macro and copybook references. All errors are listed on ERR file along with summary report. Note several iterations may be required to identify and resolve all missing macros and copybooks. GUAM E NO Support one or more GUI Graphical User Access Method dialogs for MCS, TN3270, or graphics user interface. INIT E YES Initialize all registers to hex x'F4', all memory to hex x'F5', and all uninitialized load module areas to x'F6' for easier identification of access to uninitialized registers, memory or program fields.

IPL(pgm) E none Execute 390 program at startup. LIST ALE YES Generate PRN, LST, and LOG files for assembler, linker, and execution respectively. LISTCALL MA YES Generate level macro call and exit comments in BAL file which are used by assembler to format first level macro calls preceding assembler lines with \"+\" for macro generated source. LISTUSE A YES List active USING definitions each time USING or DROP changes status in the PRN assembly listing file. LOADHIGH E YES Load programs and allocate memory for GETMAIN/STORAGE from high end of first FQE large enough to satisfy request. The ASSIST option changes this option to NOLOADHIGH causing initial program to load starting at X'8000' which simplifies relative address calculations. LOG(file) MALE pgm Set file name for ERR, TR?, and LOG files. The default is the program name. This option is required when running multiple copies of the same program via CMD startup in order to create separate unique ERR, TR?, and LOG files. Otherwise duplicate programs running in parallel will mod the same ERR, TR?, and LOG file. MACHINE A -- MACHINE / OPTABLE options determine which opcode table is used during assembly.

PARM('text') E '' Define character string parm passed to executable program via address in R1 at startup pointing to a fullword pointing to a halfword length followed by EBCDIC characters. When the length is zero, no PARM is present. PC M YES Generate macro pseudo code in cache memory for speeding up macro code that is executed more than once during macro expansion. PCOPT M YES Optimize macro pseudo code by looking for push, add/sub, store sequences and replacing them with inc/dec pseudo code opcodes. These pseudo codes are maintained in a cache in memory during macro execution only and have no effect on generated object code. PRINTALL A NO Suppress PRINT OFF and PRINT NOGEN commands to force all source lines on PRN listing. PDSMEM8 M NO If PDSMEM8 option is specified, error messages will be issued for any macro or copybook file names with length greater than 8. This option is available to provide compatibility with mainframe PDS libraries that are limited to 8 character names.

RMODE31 LE NO Set 390 load module options to load module above the 16MB line. Note this load module option requires option MEM to be set to include enough memory above the 16MB line. STATS[(file)] MALE NO Generate statistics file STA with final options listing, macro and copybook file listing, plus all program statistics. If file is omitted the program path and file name are used with STA suffix. SYS390(dir) LE pgm dir Define directory for storing and retrieving 390 load modules. SYSBAL(dir) MA pgm dir Define directory for storing and retrieving generated BAL files. This option may also override file name and/or suffix (*.sfx overrides just the suffix in the pgm directory). SYSCPY(dir) MA pgm dir Define one or more directories for retrieving CPY source input files. If the option starts with + the directories listed will be concatenated with current list. Multiple directories are always separated by +. This option may also override suffix by adding *.sfx. SYSDAT(dir) M pgm dir Define directory for retrieving DAT source input files for AREAD. Set to SYSDAT(.) for current directory when no path is specified on DSNAME parm for AREAD. SYSERR(dir) MALE pgm dir Define directory for output ERR files. This option may also override file name and/or suffix (*.sfx overrides just the suffix in the pgm directory). SYSLKD(file) L pgm dir Define input source file for linker commands such as INCLUDE, ALIAS, ENTRY, and NAME. SYSLOG(dir) E pgm dir Define directory for output LOG file. This option may also override file name and/or suffix (*.sfx overrides just the suffix in the pgm directory). SYSLST(dir) AL pgm dir Define directory for output LST files. This option may also override file name and/or suffix (*.sfx overrides just the suffix in the pgm directory). SYSMAC(dir) M mac dir Define one or more directories for source MAC files. If the option starts with + the directories listed will be appended to the maclib list. Multiple directories can be specified in one parameter and are always separated by +. When you specify this option more than once and want previous parameter instructions to remain in place, ensure that you start parameter with a <code>+</code> otherwise it will drop prior directories. This option may also override suffix by adding *.sfx. SYSMLC(dir) MA pgm dir Define directory for source input MLC files. SYSOBJ(dir) AL pgm dir Define directory for OBJ relocatable object files. SYSOPT(dir) MALE pgm dir Define directory for @file option files. This option may override suffix using *.sfx. SYSPARM('txt') M none Define text string which can be accessed by mz390 global macro variable &amp;SYSPARM. SYSPCH(dir) M pgm dir Define directory for PCH output files from PUNCH. This option may also override file name and/or suffix (*.sfx overrides just the suffix in the pgm directory). Note PUNCH output is in ASCII source format and is not directed to the OBJ file. These files may be used as linker input commands via SYSLKD(file) option. Set to SYSPCH(.) for current directory when no path is specified on DSNAME parm for PUNCH. SYSPRN(dir) A pgm dir Define directory for assembler listing PRN output files. This option may also override file name and/or suffix (*.sfx overrides just the suffix in the pgm directory). SYSTERM(file) MALE pgm.ERR Define alternate file for all start/end messages plus any error messages, plus related source file statistics for each file containing errors. The default is the program name with ERR suffix. SYSTRC(dir) MALE pgm dir Define directory for output TRACE TR? files. TEST E NO Start execution with interactive TEST mode active which prompts for commands such as T opcode or G opcode to trace or execution to the next occurrence of opcode name. TEST(ddname) E NO Define input command file to run TEST commands.ddname is an environment variable set to the name of the command file. THREAD A NO Assign continuing CSECT addresses for multiple CSECT's assembled in the same module to help identify location of instruction and data labels. TIME[(num)] MALE YES Limit execution time of each program to the number of seconds specified. The default is 15 seconds. NOTIME and NOTIMING both turn off this option. Use NOTIME to allow tasks such as SOA servers like z390CICS to run continuously while still supporting application use of timing functions. TIMING MALE YES Calculate elapsed time and instructions per second statistics for display on START/END messages and STA statistics. TIMING also displays current z390 and J2SE version on start message and memory usage on ended message. Note NOTIMING is used in regression tests to force generated files to be identical by using fixed data/time stamp using GregorianCalendar(2005,0,2,22,33,44). NOTIMING suppresses versions on start message and memory usage on ended message. NOTIMING also sets NOTIME which prevents application from using time functions. TRACE E NO Turn on ez390 execution trace generation on TRE file and turn off CON. TRACE will display every instruction executed along with address and value of each operand. Any combination of the following trace options can be set using the TRACE(...) option: AEGILMPQTV. TRACE(*) will also set TRACEALL. Note the &amp;SYSTRACE global SETC variable can be used to turn any trace options on or off during execution. See table below for details. TRACEALL MALE NO Turn on all trace options generating TRM, TRA, TRL, and TRE files and turn off CON. See table below for details. TRAP E YES Trap any unexpected J2SE program exceptions and generate emulator 0C5 exception which can be handled by SPIE/STAE exits if defined. NOTRAP can be used with Eclipse source debugger to stop at J2SE statement causing exception. TS MALE NO Generate JDBC compatible time-stamp on all TRACE and ERR file records for use in debugging time dependent issue. VCB E YES Generate VSAM cache buffer for improving VSAM performance by storing most recently accessed records and indexes. WRITENONPRINTABLE MA NO Write non-printable characters to PRN, BAL and PCH files. The default value NOWRITENONPRINTABLE replaces all non-printable characters with the '.' character. This avoids issues caused by writing control characters such as 0x0A (Line Feed) or 0x0D (Carriage Return). XREF A YES Cross reference symbols to source lines in PRN assembly listing. ZSTRMAC M YES Support expansion of ZSTRMAC structured conditional macro code instructions during loading of MLC, MAC, and CPY files. Note z390 macros in z390\\mac directory now are using zstrmac for structured coding. NOZSTRMAC can only be used with MVS, VSE, or other non-structured macro libraries. ZVSAM E 0 ZVSAM 0=no vsam, 1=zvsam1 support <p>Note on ALLOW mode: The following features are enabled in allow mode: 1. No quotes required for SETC variables 2. Duplication factor does not require (..) 3. Array declarations with variables in expression accepted 4. Substring starting beyond end returns null string 5. Quoted strings allowed in SETA and SETB expressions 6. Allow &amp;var as null string if not found during substitution 7. Allow duplicate local and global variable declarations 8. Allow AREAD and PUNCH file records greater than 80 characters.</p> <p>Note on ASCII mode: ASCII mode is not mainframe compatible and requires careful review of program to insure no EBCDIC immediate compare constants such as X'40', 64, X'F0', 240 etc. are used and that there are no assumptions about EBCDIC versus ASCII collating sequences which have numbers and letters reversed, and EBCDIC letters are non-contiguous. Typically HLASM compatible programs are run in default EBCDIC mode and DCB RECFM=FT|VT or some other translation option is used to convert between EBCDIC and ASCII where necessary. Note there are a few instructions affected by ASCII mode: 1. ED/EDMK generate ASCII versus EBCDIC but the mask must always be in EBCDIC (masks are usually coded in X'...' format) 2. UNPK generates X'3' versus X'F' in zone field (high order nibble).</p> <p>Note on CHKMAC options: - 0 - no checking - 1 - check for missing AGO and AIF labels and issue warning - 2 - also check missing labels and also check for non comment text after MEND</p> <p>Note on CHKSRC options: - 0 - no checking - 1 - check MLC or BAL input source files for any non-ASCII characters and issue error - 2 - check MLC, MAC, CPY, and BAL input source files for any non-ASCII characters and issue error - 3 - also check for out of sequence characters in 73-80 or any non-blank characters beyond 80 and issue error - - Note this should detect any EBCDIC literal character strings containing non-ASCII characters such as binary 0 byte which must be changed to hex X'00' type strings for portability.</p> <p>Note  on MNOTE options: - 0 - default generates MNOTE error/warning during mz390 and az390 - 1 - suppress mz390 error/warning and only pass MNOTE to az390 - 2 - generates MNOTE error/warning during mz390 and suppresses passing them on to az390</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/z390/z390_options/#tracing-options-and-equivalences","title":"Tracing options and equivalences","text":"<p>TRACE will display every instruction executed along with address and value of each operand.

initial test of zCOBOL compliance with the COBOL 1985 Standard.  There are 459 COBOL test programs of which 409 are currently being tested with zcoboL. See the summary statistics showing translation, assembly, and execution by 2 character program name prefix. Currently, they all translate without errors.</p> <p>See the translation statistics showing the frequency of each generated zCOBOL macro call listed in descending order by frequency followed by alphabetical list. The zCOBOL translator program zc390.java/class in z390.jar consists of 1625 lines of java code and uses regular expression parsing support to translate COBOL programs into equivalent HLASM compatible macro assembler calls.</p> <p>It's interesting to note that out of about 440,000 lines of COBOL code, the following make up over 80% of all verbs: PERIOD, MOVE, WS, PERFORM, LABEL, GO, IF, ADD, ELSE, and EXIT. - PERIOD is the name of the macro generated to process end of sentence closing   structures etc. - WS is the name of the generated macro to handle all data definitions in   working-storage and linkage section with unique qualified names. - LABEL is the generated macro to handle creating unique qualified paragraph names. The translator also maps dashes in names to underscores, double quotes to single quotes, START to ZCSTART, and END DECLARATIVES to END_DECLARATIVES to avoid assembler conflicts.</p> <p>See the Generated HLASM Assembler Instructions showing the frequency of each generated HLASM assembler instruction listed in descending order by frequency followed by alphabetical list. The zCOBOL directory currently contains 119 macros corresponding to COBOL verbs and reserved section names plus 9 copybooks totaling 7470 lines of conditional structured macro code.</p> <p>The zcobol directory macros in turn call code generation macros for the target language environment. The zcobol\\z390 directory contains 44 code generation macros and 4 copybooks totaling 13,250 lines of conditional structured macro code. Of the million plus lines of generated HLASM assembler code generated, over 80% consist of the following: DS, LARL, EQU, L, MVC, BASR, DC, MVI, LAY, USING, ORG, DROP, and BRC. - The LARL is used to address single literal pool without requiring base register.</p> <p>Much work has been done and the zCOBOL compiler does compile and execute programs including a number of EXEC CICS COBOL programs and also a number of demo and zCOBOL regression test COBOL programs. However, there is still much work to do to complete the NIST COBOL 1985 test suite. See the pending priority list and join the zCOBOL user email group to participate in future direction of zCOBOL and the setting of priorities going forward.</p> <p>The HLASM generation macros could now be copied to other target language directories for Java, C, and MASM and then modified to generate the appropriate equivalent source code. However, the current focus will remain on HLASM and since the zCOBOL generic language macros which call the code generation macros are still subject to change, delaying the start of other target language macro libraries is recommended.

The steps followed to compile the following MOVE and COMPUTE  statements are as follows:</p> <pre><code>77 FLT-SRT USAGE FLOAT-SHORT OCCURS 2.\nMOVE 1.1 TO FLT-SRT(2).\nCOMPUTE FLT-SRT(2) = FLT-SRT(2)+2.2.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>zc390 translator generates the following 2 zCOBOL verb macro call statements: <pre><code>MOVE  1.1,'TO',FLT_SRT,\"(',2,')'`   \nCOMPUTE FLT_SRT,'(',2,')',=,FLT_SRT,'(\",2,')',+,2.2\n</code></pre></li> <li>The MOVE macro uses shared copybook routine GET_FIELD_PARM to parse the two fields for MOVE and store resulting field name and symbol table index. For the literal 1.1 the index is 0, for the subscripted field, the name is set to explicit register reference including length offset(length,register) and the code is generated to set the register to address of the subscripted field.</li> <li>The MOVE macro next issues call to GEN_MOVE with the source and target field names and system table indexes.</li> <li>The GEN_MOVE macro checks the type of each field and generates appropriate code to move value from source to target field. In this case it uses LARL to set register to address of DFP short value of 1.1 in literal table and then generates MVC to move the literal to the target subscripted field.</li> <li>The COMPUTE uses GET_FIELD_PARM to obtain name and index of target field and then extracts parms in expression following the = and then calls ZC_CALC macro to generate code for expression and store result in specified target field. This macro can be used by IF and other verb macros to calculate expression for loop etc.</li> </ol> <p>The ZC_CALC macro parses the expression parameters into Backus Normal Form using two stacks. One stack has the operators in expression and the other has the field parm index pointers. Following the rules of precedence, the operators and associated parameter pointers are removed from the stacks and stored sequentially in an operation table containing the operators, 2 operands, and the target field for each operation.   </p> <p>Temporary storage fields are represented using negative indexes instead of position and a table of temporary fields created along with their type is maintained. A queue of free temporary fields is maintained and once a temporary field has been used in an operation, that temporary field is on the free queue for reuse rather than allocating a new temporary storage field.</p> <p>Once the expression has been parsed and all the operation table entries have been generated, the last target field is replaced with the result field passed to ZC_CALC and then the operation table is scanned and the generation macros for each operation are called to generate code to perform the operation.</p> <p>Just prior to generating code for an operation, the two input parameter types are used to determine the required type of result to minimize any loss of precision during the calculations. A call to GEN_MOVE is made to move the first operand field to the target field prior to performing add, subtract, etc. on the target field for operation. If the first operand is the same as the target field, the move can be omitted but that is not always possible to determine in the case of subscripting and indexing where different variables may just happen to have the same value.</p> <p>The called generation macros GEN_ADD, GEN_SUB, GEN_MPY, and GEN_DIV check the field types and perform the necessary conversion when types do not match.</p> <p>See demo added in <code>zcobol/demo/callcomp</code> directory which contains CALLCALC.MLC main assembler program which calls subroutine COMPSUM.CBL which uses COMPUTE statement to calculate sum of 15 different numeric data field types and returns sum as packed decimal for editing and display by calling program.</p> <p>There is a paper about this demo here: zcobol_COMPUTE.pdf -- Dead link</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/zCOBOL/zCOBOL_System_Programmer_Guide/#zcobol-target-source-language-generation-macros","title":"zCOBOL Target Source Language Generation Macros","text":"<p>All the target source language generation macros called by the COBOL verb macros in z390/zcobol are stored in the following directories by target language:</p> Directory Notes zcobol/z390 Generate HLASM compatible mainframe assembler source program zcobol/java Generate J2SE java compatible source program zcobol/vce Generate MS Visual Express C compatible source program zcobol/i586 Generate HLA/MASM Intel assembler compatible source program <p>Current only the z390 HLASM compatible source generation macros are being fully developed along with the required runtime support functions stored in the <code>zcobol/lib/ZC390LIB.390</code> dynamically loaded runtime module.</p> <p>zCOBOL demos include a hello world COBOL program which can be compiled and executed in each of the target environments form the same <code>zcobol/demo/HELLO.CBL</code> source program.   </p> <p>The following commands generate the corresponding source language equivalent and executable:</p> Command Generated Source Code Target Generated Executable Code Notes cblclg zcobol/demo/HELLO zcobol/demo/HELLO.MLC/BAL zcobol/demo/HELLO.390 requires z390 and J2SE on Windows/Linux ZCJAVCLG zcobol/demo/HELLO zcobol/demo/HELLO.java zcobol/demo/HELLO.class requires J2SE on Windows/Linux ZCVCECLG zcobol/demo/HELLO zcobol/demo/HELLO.ccp zcobol/demo/HELLO.exe requires MS VCE runtime on Windows ZC586CLG zcobol/demo/HELLO zcobol/demo/HELLO.HLA/ASM zcobol/demo/HELLO.exe requires HLA, MASM, and MS VCE runtime on Windows <p>If you are interested in joining in the open source zCOBOL development effort in any of the 4 target language environments or want to add another target language environment, join the zcobol development email discussion group and make your interests known.

For details, please refer to the relevant IBM manual.</p> <p>For ease of access a short summary follows here:</p> Keyword Usage and implementation in zVSAM <code>AM</code>= Optional parameter. AM=VSAM is the default. No other values are supported. <code>DDNAME</code>= DDname is required before open is executed. If DDname is not supplied on the ACB macro, the label used on the ACB macro is used as DDname. If neither is specified, a proper value must be supplied by using MODCB ACB. In zVSAM the DDname is to hold the name of an environment variable in the host OS. This variable in turn should contain the path and qualified filename of the cluster to be opened. The qualifier is the name of another environment variable in the host OS and is the path to the assembled catalog. For more information on zVSAM catalogs, please refer to the \"z390_zVSAM_Catalog_User_Guide\". <code>PASSWD</code>= Supply the address of the password, consisting of a single byte with the password's length (1-8 characters) followed by the password value. <code>EXLST</code>= Pointer to an exit list. Please see the EXLST macro description for details. <code>BUFSP</code>= Maximum buffer space in virtual storage for this cluster. This is the combined size in bytes of all buffers allocated for this cluster. If (<code>BUFND</code> + <code>BUFNI</code>) * Block_size exceeds the value specified for <code>BUFSP</code>, then <code>BUFND</code> and <code>BUFNI</code> will be reduced proportionally to keep total allocation below the limit specified in the <code>BUFSP</code> parameter. <code>BUFND</code>= Number of data buffers to allocate. Specify a number up to 65535. When over-allocating (see <code>BUFSP</code> parameter above) fewer data buffers will be allocated than requested. <code>BUFNI</code>= Number of index buffers to allocate. Specify a number up to 65535. When over-allocating (see <code>BUFSP</code> parameter above) fewer index buffers will be allocated than requested. <code>RMODE31</code>= Specifies whether buffers and/or control blocks should be allocated below the 16M line, or may be allocated above the 16M line. The default for RMODE31 is NONE. The following keywords are supported: - <code>NONE</code> Control Blocks and buffers below 16M - <code>CB</code> Control Blocks above or below 16M, buffers below 16M - <code>BUFF</code> Control Blocks below 16M, buffers above or below 16M - <code>ALL</code> Control Blocks and buffers above 16M or below 16M <code>STRNO</code>= Maximum number of strings (concurrent requests) for this ACB. If specified requires a number between 1 and 255 inclusive. <code>BSTRNO</code>= Beginning (or initial) number of strings (concurrent requests) allocated to this ACB when a path is opened. If specified requires a number between 1 and 255 inclusive. <code>MACRF</code>= List of keywords specifying how the cluster will be processed after open. The following keywords are supported: - <code>ADR/KEY</code> Non-exclusive <code>MACRF</code> keywords indicating whether the cluster may be accessed by address or by key. ADR can be used only with ESDS or KSDS to access records by RBA or XRBA. KEY can be used with KSDS to access records by key KEY can be used with RRDS to access records by relative record number. - <code>DFR/NDF</code> Mutually exclusive <code>MACRF</code> keywords indicating whether or not buffer changes need to be written out to the file immediately. - <code>DFR</code> allows zVSAM to defer writing and keep changes in the buffer. When multiple changes are combined, fewer I/Os are needed which should improve program performance. - <code>NDF</code> disallows zVSAM to defer writing, forcing a buffer write for every single change to the buffer. - <code>DIR</code>,<code>SEQ</code>,<code>SKP</code> can be coded in any combination. If none of the three is specified <code>SEQ</code> is used as a default. - <code>DIR</code> <code>MACRF</code> keyword indicating that the cluster will be processed directly. <code>DIR</code> can be used with ESDS, KSDS, or RRDS to access data randomly. - <code>SEQ</code> <code>MACRF</code> keyword indicating that the cluster will be processed sequentially. <code>SEQ</code> can be used with ESDS, KSDS, or RRDS to access data sequentially. - <code>SKP</code> <code>MACRF</code> keyword to allow skip-sequential access. I.e. specifying this keyword allows usage of the POINT macro to position the file to a specific position to access data randomly. <code>SKP</code> can be used with KSDS or RRDS to randomly position the file to a specific key or RRN prior to sequential access - <code>IN</code>/<code>OUT</code> Non-exclusive <code>MACRF</code> keywords indicating whether the cluster will be processed for input only or for both input and output. <code>OUT</code> implies <code>IN</code>. - <code>IN</code> data in the cluster can be read but not changed in any way. - <code>OUT</code> data in the cluster can be read, updated, inserted, or deleted. - <code>NIS</code>/<code>SIS</code> Mutually exclusive <code>MACRF</code> keywords indicating how zVSAM inserts new records into the cluster. Relevant only for KSDS clusters. - <code>NIS</code> Normal insert strategy: zVSAM will insert records optimizing for inserts that are dispersed randomly across the data set - <code>SIS</code> Sequential insert stragegy: zVSAM will insert records optimizing for inserts that are (generally, mostly) packed together in a sequential manner. - <code>NRM</code>/<code>AIX</code> Mutually exclusive <code>MACRF</code> keywords indicating how zVSAM is to process accesses to an AIX. Relevant only when the DDname specifies a path. - <code>NRM</code> Normal mode: zVSAM treats the AIX data as a normal KSDS. This allows direct access to the AIX's data records. - <code>AIX</code> AIX mode: zVSAM will use the AIX to access records in the underlying base cluster."},{"location":"zVSAM/zVSAM_V2_Design_Addenda/#gencb-acb-macro-parameters","title":"GENCB ACB macro parameters","text":"<p>All supported parameters are implemented compatibly with IBM's VSAM implementation.

AM=VSAM is the default. No other values are supported. <code>ACB</code>= Pointer to an open ACB that represents the clusteer to be accessed <code>AREA</code>= Record area. In Move mode reading a record implies moving the record into this area. In locate mode a pointer to the record is moved into the area instead. <code>AREALEN</code>= Length of record area <code>ARG</code>= Pointer to search argument. This is a key, a relative record number, or a RBA. <code>KEYLEN</code>= Length of key value specified in <code>ARG</code> when a generic key search is requested <code>ECB</code>= Pointer to ECB. Used with Asynchronous requests. <code>MSGAREA</code>= Pointer to a message area where error information may be returned <code>MSGLEN</code>= Length of messagea area <code>NXTRPL</code>= Pointer to next RPL in the chain.

Please see below for the list of supported keywords and their meaning. - <code>ADR</code>/<code>KEY</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether the cluster is to be accessed by address or by key. - <code>ADR</code> can be used only with ESDS to access records by RBA or XRBA. - <code>KEY</code> can be used with KSDS to access records by key, or with RRDS to access records by relative record number. - <code>DIR</code>/<code>SKP</code>/<code>SEQ</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords on the RPL macro. When none of the three is specified, a default of <code>SEQ</code> will be used. - <code>DIR</code> <code>OPTCD</code> keyword indicating that the cluster is to be processed directly. can be used with ESDS, KSDS or RRDS to access data randomly - <code>SEQ</code> <code>OPTCD</code> keyword indicating that the cluster is to be processed sequentially. can be used with ESDS, KSDS, or RRDS to access data sequentially - <code>SKP</code> <code>OPTCD</code> keyword to request skip-sequential access. can be used with KSDS to randomly position the file to a specific key prior to sequential access can be used with RRDS to randomly position the file to a specific RRN prior to sequential access - <code>ARD</code>/<code>LRD</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether the cluster is to be accessed as specified by the user/current position, or just the very last record. - <code>FWD</code>/<code>BWD</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether the cluster is to be accessed in a forward or backward direction - <code>SYN</code>/<code>ASY</code> Synchronous or asynchronous handling of the request. - <code>NUP</code>/<code>UPD</code>/<code>NSP</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether or not the record is to be locked for update. Updates are allowed if the cluster was opened with the <code>OUT</code> option specified. <code>NSP</code> is used only with <code>OPTCD</code>=<code>DIR</code>: retain file position, to enable sequential access from this point. - <code>KEQ</code>/<code>KGE</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether the key has to match exactly (<code>KEQ</code>) or \u2013 if an exact match cannot be found \u2013 the next higher value is acceptable too. - <code>FKS</code>/<code>GEN</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether we're doing a full key search, or we're specifying only a partial key value. In the latter case <code>KEYLEN</code> has to be specified to indicate how many key positions we're specifying. - <code>MVE</code>/<code>LOC</code> Mutually exclusive OPTCD keywords indicating whether we're working in move mode (zVSAM moves record between user record buffer and zVSAM buffer) or in locate mode (record is not moved, data are processed in the zVSAM buffer, zVSAM provides a pointer only) - <code>RBA</code>/<code>XRBA</code> Mutually exclusive <code>OPTCD</code> keywords indicating whether we're using 4-byte RBA values or 8-byte extended RBA values."},{"location":"zVSAM/zVSAM_V2_Design_Addenda/#gencb-rpl-macro-parameters","title":"GENCB RPL macro parameters","text":"<p>All supported parameters are implemented compatibly with IBM's VSAM implementation.
