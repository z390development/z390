# HLASM compatible structured programming macros (SPM)

This folder previously contained a version of the z390 SPM macros that are compatible with HLASM. 

This has been removed from the z390 source.
The z390 distribution will contain a generated version of the macros here.

If you are working with source version of z390 and wish to use the spm folder, use the following command to generate the macros:

* `bash\bldzstrmac mac\spm` for MacOS and Linux 
* `bat\bldzstrmac mac/spm` for Windows
