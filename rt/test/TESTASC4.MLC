* 03/22/06 RPI 251 ADD TEST BREAK ON CGXR AND VERIFY TRACE
*********************************************************************
*
* THIS EZ390 REGRESSION TEST PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT THE TEST REMOTE
* INPUT DDNAME BE SET TO TESTTST1.TF1 FILE WHICH CONTAINS TEST
* COMMANDS WHICH ARE VALIDATED BY THE CODE IN THIS PROGRAM
*
* TEST SEQUENCE:
*   1.  TEST REG MODIFY CMDS AT FIRST INSTR.
*   2.  TEST G AND T FOR UP TO LR INSTR.
*   3.  TEST MODIFY MEMORY AT 300. AND THEN RUN TO CGXR TO VERIFY
*   4.  TEST JUMP AND OC1 AT BAD OPCODE AND THEN RETURN VIA J 12R%
*   5.  ZOOM TO END WHICH INCLUDES VERIFY OF CGXR AT RESUME POINT
