THE CONTROL FLOW FOR DEMOMAIN SOA EXECUTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

1.  DEMOSMGR SERVER OPENS TCP/IP SOCKETS HOST PORT AND LISTENS
    FOR MESSAGES FROM ANY CLIENTS.

2.  DEMOMAIN CLIENT APPLICATION STARTS UP AND ISSUES CALL TO 
    DEMOSUB1 SOA STUB STATICALLY LINKED CODE.
    
3.  DEMOSUB1 STUB CODE LOADS AND CALLS DEMOCMGR PASSING NAME OF 
    SERVICE CALL AND THE STANDARD CALLING PARM LIST FOR DEMOSUB1.
    
4.  DEMOCMGR FINDS MSG PROGESSING CODE FOR NAMED SERVICE, BUILDS
    MESSAGE WITH SERVICE NAME AND PARMS, AND SENDS MESSAGE TO
    SOA HOST SERVER VIA TCP/IP PORT, AND WAITS FOR REPSONSE.

RUN SOA\DEMO\DEMOSTD.BAT

TO RUN THE DEMO AS SOA CLIENT SERVER APPLICATION 
RUN SOA\DEMO\DEMOSOA.BAT

TO SEE INSTRUCTION TRACE FOR ABOVE ADD OPTIONS TRACE CON

NOTICE THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING DEMOSTD AND DEMOSOA IS
THAT FOR DEMOSTD ALL THE WTO'S APPEAR ON SINGLE DEMOMAIN.LOG AND 
FOR DEMOSOA, THE SERVER WTOS' APPEAR ON DEMOSMGR.LOG INSTEAD.

NOTE THE CLIENT DEMOMAIN CAN BE RUN REPEATEDLY WITH SAME SERVER RUNNING.
