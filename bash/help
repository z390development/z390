echo "The following bash scripts are intended as a user interface:"
echo "asm    - Assemble an assembler source file"
echo "asml   - Assemble and link an assembler source file"
echo "asmlg  - Assemble, link and go (execute) an assembler source file"
echo "assist - asmlg for an assembler source file having ASSIST opcodes"
echo "cblc   - Compile a COBOL source file"
echo "cblcl  - Compile and link a COBOL source file"
echo "cblclg - Compile, link and go (execute) a COBOL source file"
echo "debug  - Execute a previously linked program in interactive debugger"
echo "exec   - Execute a previously linked program"
echo "help   - This help overview"
echo "link   - Link a previously assembled or compiled program"
echo "mac    - Run the macro processor"
echo "z390   - Start the z390 graphical user interface"
echo "z390w  - Wrapper for all the above; used when bash directory in path"
echo " "
echo "All these commands (except help, z390 and z390w) require as their first"
echo "argument the path and name of the file to be processed."
echo "The following rules apply:"
echo "- all output files will appear in the same directory as the input file"
echo "- the path can be absolute or relative; relative means starting from the"
echo "  current working directory"
echo "- the path separator character must be the *nix separator - forward slash"
echo "- the file extension may be omitted but is required for the file name;"
echo "  the default (and only) extensions are"
echo "    MLC for assembler source files"
echo "    CBL for COBOL source files"
echo "    OBJ for object files"
echo "    390 for executable files"
echo " "
echo "The z390w takes only one argument: the name of the bash command to wrap."
echo "While z390w may be used to wrap any command in the bash directory"
echo "(except itself), its intended use is to avoid name conflicts when the"
echo "user has added the z390 bash directory to their shell path. For example,"
echo "\"exec\" is a shell builtin, so use \"z390w exec [options]\" instead of"
echo "\"exec [options]\" to avoid the name conflict."
echo " "
echo "All commands, except help and z390w, may optionally take additional"
echo "parameters. These optional parameters are documented on the z390 web"
echo "site or on GitHub at https://github.com/z390development/z390; go to"
echo "    doc -> user_guide -> z390 -> z390_options.md."
echo "If you need additional macro and/or copybook libraries, or you"
echo "need any other non-default parameters for your user program, please use"
echo "an options file to define these. To make use of an options file, specify"
echo "the optional parameter @path/optionsfilename. Options files have"
echo "extension OPT."
