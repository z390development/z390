KSF1.TXT - Documentation of KSDS demo

1. Create KSDS file KSF1NAME from QSAM 80 byte text records using REPRO
   and the KSF1NAME DEMOCAT catalog entry with primary name key field
   in positions 1-20:

   KSF1NAME - KSDS CLUSTER WITH PRIMARY KEY NAME KEY (20,0)
   KSF1ADDR - KSDS ALT INDEX WITH ADDR KEY (20,20)
   KSF1CITY - KSDS ALT INDEX WITH CITY KEY (20,40)
   KSF1STAT - KSDS ALT INDEX WITH STAT KEY (10,60)
   KSF1ZIP  - KSDS ALT INDEX WITH ZIP  KEY (10,70)
   NAMELIST - READ KSF1NAME WITH NO INDEX UPDATE USING PATH
   ADDRLIST - READ KSF1ADDR AIX PATH WITH NO UPDATES
   CITYLIST - READ KSF1CITY AIX PATH WITH NO UPDATES
   STATLIST - READ KSF1STAT AIX PATH WITH NO UPDATES
   ZIPLIST  - READ KSF1ZIP  AIX PATH WITH NO UPDATES

2. Use BUILDAIX utility to read primary KSDS and create AIX
   using INFILE and OUTFILE DDNAME's where INFILE points to 
   primary cluster catalog entry and OUTFILE points to 
   alternate index to be created.

3. Use REPRO to unload the KSDS file in name sequence by setting
   INFILE to either KSF1NAME or NAMELIST alias path catalog entry
   which provides access in name sequence without AIX updates.

4. Use REPRO to unload each alternate index in alternate index
   sequence by setting INFILE to corresponding AIX PATH catalog entry.

5. The original text file for KSF1NAME load via REPRO contains:

NAME (1-20)         ADDR (21-40)        CITY (41-60)        STATE     ZIP
AK                  HOLLAND             AMPSTERDAM          HL        123
DSH                 USA                 TAMPA BAY           FL        456
